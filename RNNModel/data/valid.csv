"without a doubt , this be the largest unit we ' ve ever trade , and we ' ve be trade for over 10 year . this be the largest hilton in the world and i believe it . it ' s so big land wise , it ' s difficult to put into word the scale of this resort . i think summer bay be big . . this make it look tiny . there ' s a shuttle that go around the resort , but like most place in florida , you ' ll need a car . check in be at 4pm , and at 10 past 4 , the lobby be a zoo . the place be move at full speed , but there be still about 30 people in front of me . one of the employee be pass out free cup of bud light to the people wait . i ' m not a bud light guy , but i appreciate the kind gesture . check- in be smooth . we learn that this place be a cash- le resort , meaning you could charge everything to your room card or on a credit card of your choice . the sale staff weren ' t too pushy . after check in , i be escort to the sale area to do the dance i ' ve do so many time before . honestly , i couldn ' t hear a word he be say because it be so noisy in the lobby and the fact that i be stand shoulder to shoulder with a guest next to me talk to another sale person . . it be nut ! if youre not interested in a timeshare , just say no . no tour . no meeting . no free stuff . just enjoy your stay . we stay in east village , just north of the popular river island . . . like others have say , if you want to be in the center of the fun and hustle and bustle , try to stay at river island . i didnt see too many people in our building , so it be quiet most time . our unit be a 2 bed , 2 bath and , we later learn , be just renovate . . . be we impress ? you bet we be ! the unit be enormous ! i win ' t bore you with the detail of the room , but here ' s some key feature : generous tile foyer with inlaid wall art . . 2 queen bed in the spare room . king bed in the master . huge master bath with jet tub and stand up shower . pocket door everywhere if you need to keep the noise down in certain area . full size , side by side washer and dryer . closet galore . 15 foot countertop , yes 15 foot with an upper and lower tier ! the living room be spacious with a large bank of window behind a sofa , loveseat and chair . . . this place be make for entertain . the 32 inch flat be recess into the counter . a little small for a tv , but i didnt go on vacation to watch television . everything be new and very well design . also , there ' s a perfect spot to watch the nightly fireworks at disney in the 12 x 12 screened- in patio . no housekeeping ? no shit . ask yourself how many housekeeper would it take to clean every room every day ? the place be clean when you walk in , now clean up after yourself , ya f* * * ing slob . you need towel , do a load of towel . sink dirty ? clean it up . garbage pile up ? tie it up and take it to the garbage chute . wtf , ppl . anyway . . . the wifi be free . the signal be strong and very reliable . i didn ' t go to the timeshare meeting ( i never do ) , but i speak with someone who do . they ' re first number be 64k for a timeshare . i be floor . people be give away these unit on ebay . however , if i want a timeshare in orlando , i would definitely choose this resort and i would absolutely recommend this place to others , especially if they have child . my only complaint be the noise . . and i don ' t fault the resort on this . this resort be so large , it must take an army of staff to keep it look this nice . . . . but at 3am , i be lie awake in bed ask myself , `` why do i hear a lawnmower ? `` sure enough , there ' s a guy buzz back and forth on the fairway about 300 yard away from my building . all i could see be his headlight . then the next morning i hear a chainsaw right outside the door . the next night all the wildlife keep me up . hey . . i know shit get ta get do , and i wouldnt have care if i didnt have a 3 year old who need his nap . later on , i take a closer look at the window in the unit , because i shouldnt be hear all this from the 6th floor . i find the window be thin , single pane , and non- insulated . . just there to keep the water and bug out . the following night , we run 8 hour youtube video of white noise on the laptop , which make a world of a difference . river island be a blast ! the pool be like nothing i have ever see . you can tube along the lazy river use their rental tube , use a tube that you buy for 5 buck at walgreens ( update : not a good move , apparently ) , or you can swim the river . the poolside drink be pretty decent at 10 buck a bucket ( $ 8 for a refill ) . plenty of lounge chair in the sun and shade . kid all over the place , so my little guy be a happy a a clam . i didn ' t spend a dime use the pool or lazy river , but i hear someone say it be $ 20 for a week/ person to use the water slide . i dont find that unreasonable . thats one round of drink . . of course , i dont have 6 kid either . there be so much to do and see , and we didn ' t even scratch the surface of this resort .",1,1172
"i stay here with a friend last month for 5 night in a row , we be so disappointed . i don ' t even know where to begin , so here it go . . . we check in the first night . . . didn ' t notice anything wrong . it be a room with a tiny section with a mini fridge which didn ' t work , kitchen sink , no silverware to use which would of helped . the second night , a i wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom , i decide not to turn on the light so i wouldn ' t wake anyone up , but realize i couldn ' t see a thing in the dark so once i turn on the light . . . . about a dozen of roach different size run everywhere . i scurry for toilet paper to kill the sucker and only manage to catch 2 , they be run all over the foot towel . it be disgust . a few hour later my roommate go to the restroom and a i be use the sink outside the restroom , another med size roach be run up the door . after breakfast , we go to speak to the be front reception , she have switch our room not know what room yet due to it be early @ 8am and check out won ' t be till 1pm , she tell u that we would have our new room available when we come back , so we be ok , agree , pack our luggage and leave them in the office . we be go the entire day/ night . we come back around midnight , and rechecked in with the pm receptionist ( shawn ) who be lovely at first . he claim that the day receptionist didn ' t make any reservation for u and that he couldn ' t find u in his system . oh boy . . . . this be where it all begin . i be explain to him our situation , while the maintenance guy ( wilfredo ) who be sit there rudely interrupt me , state , `` there be no roach in this hotel , i guarantee it ! ! ! `` finally , shawn find the reservation , we pick our luggage up and head to the new room . it be about 1am , we be both drain and just want to shower and sleep . a my roommate open the bathroom door , guess what she saw . . . . a waterbug and a roach mating . . . . can it get any worse ? so i call the front desk , shawn be annoy and this time he be totally out of place . he ask me , what would i like to do , he say he could switch me to another room , but 2 second later he say there ' s no room available and tell me that he would refund my money and that we should go to another hotel . i be shock . . . the tone of his voice be very condescending , disrespectful , and just plan out unprofessional , he tell me that he have 3 customer in front of him and that he couldn ' t speak to me , so he tell me to decide on what we want to do and call him back , so he hang up a i be speak to him . he also state , i quote , : you guy be not nice people ! ! `` how be we not nice ? just cause we ask him to send someone over to kill the waterbug ? i mean i ' m on vacation , i ' m not home nor and i the exterminator . then finally he send the housekeeping runner at night ( matt ) to come kill the waterbug . when i go to the door i ask him to show id , since he didn ' t have a name badge , he then be a bit annoyed cause i be ask him who he be , it be nice of him to kill the bug and leave . oh , i be tell shawn to please send wilfredo to our room since he have guarantee that this hotel have no roach but accord to shawn he leave for the night . after breakfast the next day , we have speak to chad ( mgr ) he have ask me what we would like to do , but he couldn ' t do much about anything , he just nod and apologize . why offer anything when you have no control over anything . they have already credit u the resort fee , i mean how do you even charge a resort fee ? this place doesn ' t even qualify a a resort . we opt not to switch to another hotel since we have already pack , repacked , and pack so many time that we both just decide to just deal with it and let it be cause we be leave in a few day anyways . most of the days/ night we weren ' t even in the room . i mean overall , if i could , i would not rate this even a a 1 star hotel , it ' s more like a rinky dinky motel . they barely leave enough body , face , hand towel . the breakfast be the same thing every morning . . . frozen waffle , some day there be enough bagel/ muffin , cereal , tea , juice . the wait line for the toaster be ridiculous , there be 3 small toaster but only 1 work and a large toaster that you have to toast at least 3 time to even get a good toast . we decide to get breakfast elsewhere everyday after the 2nd day . the line be so long just for breakfast and toasting . if you be look to just spend a quick night or 2 , it will be good for you . but if you think this be a luxurious hotel cause they charge a resort fee , i would suggest you not to waste your time , money , or energy cause you will be disappoint . the plus of this hotel be in the least the 2 queen bed be comfortable . wifi be very shotty and didn ' t really work that ' s why it ' s free . the pool didn ' t even open till 11am on most day . we hear the elevator be scary that ' s why we never want anything past the first floor .",0,1159
"i would never return and i would warn you to avoid at all cost . this will honestly be a long read , but know that i be not complain for complain purpose . i have specific reason why you should not stay here with your child . we arrive late and the front desk ( corey i believe ) , be sweet , nice and very friendly . we start walk to our room and the horror begin . the hallway of building six ( specify for a reason ) be dilapidate and be not take care of . the rug , wall , and door look dirty and not maintain . i can overlook this a i be not expect a hotel catering to child to maintain the exterior on a 24 hour basis . we get to our room , my wife immediately notice that the luggage mat have wet gum on it , the dresser have a huge scuff mark and the wall and rug be also dirty . i can semi understand the hallway , but why aren ' t the room maintain ? i tell my wife , let ' s just go get something to eat a it be late . we go downstairs to the tradewinds `` restaurant '' . pizza and wing be okay , not much to be desire . we go back to the room and i walk into the bathroom and the bath hook be hang by a screw . with very minimal effort i be able to remove the hook from the door ( be about to fall off ) . it be heavy enough hurt to anyone . a shelf in the shower be be hold by a strip of glue ( i have video of me move the shelf fairly easily ) . i call front desk and be tell someone would be right up . . . of course no one ever show up . next morning , before i head downstairs to speak to the front desk . . . i ' m greet in the shower by a little critter friend . so aside be unsafe , this place now have roach . so i head to complain to the front desk to speak to a manager , none be available . i speak to ethan , a nice young man who be very accommodate and understand . he explain a manager would soon be in , but i be head out . he state , even manager yosh , would be in later when i return . i hand the hook over to tania who be incredibly sweet and explain she would have a manager and maintenance look into it . when i return from my day , i speak to yosh , who be aware of the hook issue and say the issue should have be fix . i show him the picture if the little critter , the dresser ' s scuff mark , the bathroom ' s shelf and hook . he be easy to deal with and work with me to appease me . he say that someone would be in the next following day to take care of the shelf a he be unaware of it ( completely okay with me ) . he put some note into the system to credit me for my hassle . same night we call for extra towel . . . it ' s 6 day later , and i be still wait for those towel . at this point , my grow frustration be not worth call front desk and or speak to a manager . . . so i will now list themice machine be not work , have to go a floor up . hallway would stay dirty for day . i saw the same paper and plastic in front of a door for two day , never clean . on our fourth night we return from the park , i lay down on the bed and saw a huge roach on the ceiling . i kill it myself ( against my wife ' s wish ) , and take a picture of it next to the coco key tv chart to show that be what i find at that hotel . i have two room ( party of 6 ) , the other room ' s bathtub be clog . i have to speak to front desk . they come to clear the clog , and leave the entire bathroom a dirty mess . my parent need to speak with front desk to clean the bathroom ( even though the cleaning crew have pass the room ) . which lead too . . . u notice that bathroom floor be never clean . dirty sheet be not clean even if they be noticeably dirty . you have to specifically ask them to be clean ( because they `` conserve water '' ) . now . . . . for the reason why i mention the building # . you have to enter the main lobby and walk past several room before you get to the water park . all visible rooms/ hallway be well kept . which lead me to believe , if you order directly from them , they take care of you , if you order through discount/ bundle site ( will not mention which ) , they pretty much say , your cheap , so you get cheap care . remember the shower shelf . . . . six day later , shelf be still not fix . on my very last night , not one , but both key card be de- activate . they want to give me some excuse that cell phone and credit de- activate these card . . . but how can this happen to both card , when my son be hold one , and he doesn ' t have a cell phone or credit card . finally . . . last day just to be sure that i do get my credit i go to check out and of course . . . there be no note in the system and i do not receive my credit . the front desk ask why i be receive a credit . . . . it take everything in me not yo say `` because your hotel be crap '' ! from huge roach to dirty bathroom , this hotel be disgust and not safe for child . i do not see an option to upload pic , but if i find one later , i will glad to post . i would not recommend this place at all . avoid at all cost !",0,1136
"i wish i could give this a better review ( and wish i could ' ve get a better room ) . these `` value '' hotel ( all- star movie , all- star music , all- star sport , and the new art of animation ) may be the best option price- wise for stay on wdw ground , but be it really that good of a deal if you leave tire , hurt , and turn off by the food offer by the hotel ? the bed be hard a rock , and my husband and i have both wake up each day stiff and in some pain because of it . the cover on the bed be minimal ; there be a top sheet with a thin , rough blanket on top of it , and then another sheet ( print to look like it ' s a duvet cover , but still just a sheet ) on top of that . it mimic the look of have a thin comforter on the bed , but there isn ' t one , just two sheet and an awful old blanket . the air conditioning be set on 68* f , and it can not be change . the air flow in through a big air vent above the thermostat . on a hot day - it ' s be 90* this week - the air be barely chill at all , and if you want to cool down you have to stand directly under it . by the middle of the night , however , the 68* becomes very , very cold , and that ' s about when you realize the thin , rough blanket you have be grossly inadequate . ( also , bug come through that vent . they ' re lovebugs and harmless , but still . bugs. ) the pillow be either rock- hard or thin with little substance . we have a king- sized bed , and be give four . we have to ask for more , because two of those pillow do not equal one good pillow . one thing i always seem to forget about at disney be that one of the thing you ' re pay for in the nicer hotel be insulation . sound insulation . the wall in this and the other value hotel be ridiculously thin , and we can hear everything the room on either side of u be do . unfortunately , on one side , there be 7 people jam into their tiny room , and they ' re partiers whose antic can last well past 3 be . we also have have issue with drunk . we ' ve be swamp during this visit with ton of people who be completely drunk and yell all the time . while i know there be no malicious intent , we ' ve have several people all of a sudden start try to open our front door and then pound on it somewhere in the very early morning . we try to call security to see if someone could intercept the group and ask them not to do that , but security wasn ' t willing to confront them , so this go on with a bunch of different people for the entire length of our stay . ( we try to talk to them nicely . it didn ' t work. ) housekeeping be incredibly poor . they make the bed , which be nice to see when you walk in after a long day , but that ' s all they do . nobody empty trash can or take use towel away , nor do they seem to want to leave new one , or give you more than one set of toiletry . the only way we be able to get housekeep to help u at all be by finally go over their head and speak to the front desk instead , and we have to do that multiple time . in order to get an extra pillow , an extra blanket , and another little bottle of shampoo , it take 5 request over a many day . there be a food court that be open until midnight , but know when you go in that their food be very much `` meh '' . just . . . okay . not horrible , but not all that good , either . and there be so much wonderful food to be find in the park ( and even in other hotel ! ) that it seem like a waste of money . it ' s cheaper , sure , but why spend your money on bland food with little variety when you could have a stellar meal deliver to you by room service ? one of the bonus to stay on wdw property be the transportation system , which save you from ever need a car . there be bus that will take you just about anywhere , but in time where the park be crowd , they run quite a bit longer than the 15 minute they ' re suppose to run at . sometimes , without warn ( and always near a park ' s closing ) , all three all- star hotel be cut down to only one bus without warning , and that get very uncomfortably crowd fast . the disabled be easily leave behind when this happen . it doesn ' t happen with the better hotel . my advice : save your money . even if it mean it ' ll be longer until you can come to disney world , save up for your hotel . skip the moderate resort ; they be almost the same a the value resort - same layout sometimes , approximately same room size , same food option , same `` amenity '' , same bed , same outside door instead of be inside . the only thing you ' re really pay for be nicer or more interesting theming , and you ' ll be a few line closer to the front when take a bus back to your hotel from one of the park . that ' s not worth the price hike . save up and treat yourself to one of the deluxe hotel . it ' s exponentially better ( and it doesn ' t mean stay at the most expensive one ) . where you stay do make a difference in your experience . don ' t bother with the value hotel - when it come down to it , it ' s just not an actual value at all .",0,1129
"we just return from a 4- day weekend at the jw marriott orlando grande lake . i be really excite about this hotel because ( 1 ) it ' s a jw marriott so i figure the service and amenity would be amazing , ( 2 ) the pool area be gorgeous , and ( 3 ) i be just happy to be go on vacation . unfortunately my first impression of this hotel be le than amazing . here ' s why : room : i reserve the room in april and request a room with double bed . i call about 2 week before the trip to make sure that our reservation be on file and that my double- bed request would be honor . they promise it would . i call one hour before i check in and let the front desk know that we be run late for check- in and remind them that i want a room with double bed . . . the girl at the front desk say that it wouldn ' t be a problem . i check in at 10 : 00 pm thursday night and guess what ? no double bed ! how be that possible ? the lady at the front desk suggest that i check with them in the morning and maybe they would have a room available . so in the meantime they put u in room 4009 with a king bed and a sofa bed . there be no doubt that the room be beautiful , but a king bed be not what i request . we be two adult and one child and i want my daughter to have her own bed ( not a roll- away bed or sofa bed a the front desk kindly suggest ) . the following day i call the front desk and they say they could transfer u to another room with double- bed . perfect ! so we go to room 5009. the room be gorgeous . the bathroom be spacious and have a large tub and everything be clean . however , there be 3 thing they need to fix in the room ( i notice this in both room ) : ( 1 ) there must be something wrong with the ac in the room because the neither room would get cold . i have the ac at 65 the entire time and be sweat the whole night ! ( 2 ) the shower door need a better seal because the water get out from the bottom and make a huge puddle . the bathroom rug be soak the entire weekend so we waste towel on soak up the floor , and ( 3 ) the bed be extremely uncomfortable . i have a bad back a it be and i wake up with a sore back every day . even my 8 year- old daughter be complain about the bed be too hard . self- parking/ valet : we decide we would self- park a it ' s cheaper ( $ 19 ) than the valet ( $ 27 ) . my bf go out and when he come back the room card didn ' t work to get into the lot . in fact , the card never work . so the hotel be very accommodate and let u valet for the price of the self- parking . thank you ! ( please read my update regard the valet service ) pool area : the pool be beautiful . i have zero complaint about this because it ' s exceptional . extremely child- friendly and completely clean . the service at the pool be great too . starbucks : a starbucks on site ? awesome ! the price ? terrible . this starbucks bump up the price because it ' s attach to the hotel . a coffee and an apple juice should not cost $ 9. but i ' m a sucker for my coffee and i pay it anyway ( shame on me. ) wi- fi : no free wi- fi ? anywhere in the hotel ? no ? that ' s crazy . for the amount of money guest pay there the least they could do be provide free wi- fi . c ' mon now ! check out : check out be a breeze and the gentleman that help me be wonderful . with the exception of the hotel room , self- parking hiccup , and the wi- fi and starbucks rip- off , the hotel be great . however , a hotel of this caliber should work with their customer request a little better . update : this update be relate to the hertz car rental onsite and the hotel valet . i receive an email from hertz today ( 7/ 1/ 14 ) with a copy of my invoice for car rental service . the receipt be for double what i be suppose to pay . i rent a car for a day on saturday , june 28 and be tell by shawn from hertz that i could return the car to the hotel valet because the hertz office would be close after 6pm . i return the car to valet the same day ( 6/ 28 ) at 7pm . i explain to valet that i be return a rental and the guy say it be not a problem . so today ( 2 day later ) i call hertz to ask why i be be bill for 2 day instead of 1 and nina say that the valet return that car yesterday morning ! ! ! i be already home in miami yesterday morning . when i tell nina that she say `` well i have to go by what the valet write on the receipt and they claim you return the car yesterday morning '' i say `` that ' s impossible because i check out of the hotel on sunday ( 6/ 29 ) ! `` she have the audacity to say `` it ' s your word against his so please call the hertz billing center. `` so where be the car this whole time ? do the valet forget to log it in ? do he take it for a day ? who know ! so a i type this i ' m on hold with the hotel billing department to get a copy of my invoice so that i can send this to hertz and they can figure out what happen . wow . what a terrible experience with this hotel .",1,1111
"i be con twice within my first 12 hour at the hotel , the ceiling in my room leak water , and the internet be extremely slow - - about a slow a you ' ll ever see in a hotel circa 2013. but back to the scam . . . you have to be extremely alert here because the hotel have exclusive arrangement with shady service provider : i go to the front desk and ask if they could call a taxi for me . i need to go to the radisson , about 3 . 5 mile away , to rent a car from their in- house rental firm . here ' s the sequence : 1. the front desk guy make the call . i go wait outside . a few minute later a man approach me to confirm that i ' m the person who need to go to the radisson . he direct me to an unmarked car . ( he ' s not the driver - - he appear to be a coordinator of some kind. ) 2. i ' m confuse by the unmarked car , but they know where i be go so it must be them . i get in the backseat . 3. nothing happens . i ' m sit in the backseat of the car . the driver be not in the car . he ' s stand with the coordinator a few yard away . they ' re just have a casual conversation . i ' m not sure what ' s go on . 4. confused , i get out of the car and ask them `` be this a taxi ? `` . they say yes . so then i say `` ummm . . . can we go now ? `` 5. the driver get in and we ' re off . 6. i notice that the meter- like box on the car ' s dash be turn off or inoperable - - just a blank display . 7. we get to the radisson property . the driver go the wrong way on a one- way street on the property - - where the street be prominently guard with `` do not enter '' sign . 8. after wander around the property for a while , he drop me off at a random point on the property . he say the price be $ 18. i pay him . 9. after he drive off , i discover that i be not at the entrance of the hotel . i have to walk a long loop around the property , about 1/ 3 to 1/ 2 mile , before come upon the lobby entrance ( it ' s a large , sprawling , resort- style property , and all the other entrance be key for guest only ) . 10. i tell the front desk staff what happen , and focus on these point : i ask them to call me a taxi . i do not get a taxi . whatever we want to call this service of a random guy in a random car , it be not a taxi - - taxi have meter , taxi be mark a taxi , and taxi take you where you want to go . it also turn out i be overcharge . you can go online and find out what an orlando- area taxi would cost for any give trip - - just enter the address . a taxi would ' ve cost me $ 13. so i pay 38 % more for a sketchy , dangerous service that didn ' t even get me to my destination . the front desk staff do nothing . the employee tell me that he be not allow to call any other company than that company - - i. e. they will not grant your request that they call a taxi ( and they win ' t tell you that they ' re not call a taxi. ) at the same time , he try to argue that the hotel be not affiliate with the company - - not affiliate with this company that he just note they have an exclusive arrangement with . in any case , they do nothing . even stranger , they didn ' t seem to think that this be a big deal - - that put their guest in sketchy unmarked car that will charge them more than a taxi and might sometimes deliver them to their destination be not really a big deal . they didn ' t apologize - - it be all just defensive `` it ' s not our fault '' and `` we have nothing to do with them ( even though we will only call them , because they give u a cut ) `` . moreover , they be clearly not even consider the possibility of stop this practice - - of act on new knowledge that they be harm their guest , that perhaps they should stop harm their guest . i bring it up a few more time in the subsequent day - - i be attend a five day management conference at the dolphin - - always calm , never abusive . nothing happen until the fourth day , when finally they call the fake taxi company and get them to refund my money . the hotel do nothing to compensate me or even apologize . in fact , the vast majority of the time that they say they ' d call me back with more info , no one call me back . throughout , i be almost scientifically fascinate by the hotel staff ' s lack of concern . i wasn ' t complain about the towel - - the hotel ' s action directly cause me to lose money , to be in a car drive the wrong way on one- way street , and to be deliver to the wrong place . every time they put their guest in one of these sketchy car , they ' re basically take $ 5 or $ 10 out of their guest ' wallet and light it on fire , and that ' s best case , assume everything else go fine . hotwire keep come up in conversation - i book the room through hotwire instead of my reward club account . perhaps they don ' t care about guest who book through hotwire ? it shouldn ' t matter , not for something like this .",0,1106
"palisade resort be like the late 40 ' s woman at the end of the bar desperate to relive her twenty . she look grand far away , but closeup you can see the mark where the makeup be apply with a trowel , and you begin to wonder what else be hide . first the good part . the room be huge . full apartment with separate room for the kid , one for parent , a full kitchen , huge bathroom . washer and dryer , plenty of closet space . if i be look for an apartment , this would be it . close to disney . and much cheaper then most of their room in the same `` quality '' range . the bad part : 1. ) credit card be charge for a full day rate out of a three day stay over a month ahead of time . a a business traveler who have stay in over 40 hotel in the last year alone , this be unheard of . this cause me a small amount of trouble a i didn ' t have a receipt to send to my company account department , especially for a service i hadn ' t even receive yet . 2. ) there seem to be two of the same road name , thus two `` location '' for the actual resort . the first one in google map be the incorrect one . not their fault , but certainly a strike in the `` easy and quick to get to '' column . 3. ) i witness both night clerk at the front desk be down right hostile to customer . one seem put out that he have to find out if another customer ' s room ' s sink be leak still , or if it have be fix . consider that ' s a huge deal , and the fact that it be nearly midnight , that seem to me that it should have be log and common knowledge among all the staff . the other one be very curt to question another customer ask regard place to find breakfast , etc . 4. ) the carpet and wall in common area be both stain and damage . it ' s obvious they go through a lot of trouble to paint over and repair the problem part on the wall , but you can easily see little circle of slightly different shade of paint . the carpet have similar issue . you can actually see where piece have be cut out and replace , or the remains of stain . 5. ) the entire place smell of chemical cleaning product . it smell like `` new house '' or `` new carpet '' smell . that distinct formaldehyde base smell that make buy new carpet and car so annoy . it be so powerful that my nose be totally stuff by morning and heavily contribute to a sleepless night . 6. ) only one access path to the parking garage . not a big deal , but annoy when your room be at one end of the hotel , your car be directly under you , but you have to walk half the distance of the building and back to get to the car . 7. ) unclearly paint exit and entrance sign to the parking garage , along with unclear signage to reception . not bad , but enough to cause confusion or out right miss it if you ' re not look . 8. ) super thin wall , floor , and ceiling . we be keep up until 1am by various sound from room all around u . from the guy argue with his so on the phone and cuss up a storm , to the kid run up and down the hallway on the floor above . a big deal when i have to be up by 5am . 9. ) $ 40 early termination fee when i check out at 5am . seriously . yet again i ' ve never have to deal with something like that and i end up leave early frequently a my job schedule more time need all the time just in case . if it ' s at noon , or 5pm , then i can see be charge an early termination fee . . . but when leave at five be ? 10. ) most uncomfortable hotel bed i ' ve ever be on . the bed be some sort of thin mattress support on a fancy futon type frame . if be extremely hard , yet thin enough that the slat under the mattress could easily be felt . just to get some sleep i move to one of the twin bed in the `` kid room , `` but soon end up sleep on the couch a the most comfortable bed in the place . 11. ) for a `` resort '' i felt the building fell extremely short of the mark . it seem more like a repurposed and shoddily build apartment complex that be put up in two week then a place i ' d actively seek out a a destination for my dream vacation . 12. ) black mold on the ceiling in the main bathroom . there be an obvious leak in the roof above that room cause mold to grow in the dry wall , but the front desk clerk didn ' t want to hear about it when i call down to report it . all of the above add together really make palisade unattractive . it ' s not the worse place i ' ve ever be force to stay in , that honor go to the place that only have one channel and that be a scratchy old porn tape on loop . i realize that most of these issue be not the fault of the management , but be environmental . a few of the problem can easily be fix though and would jump my review up at least one , and very possibly two star . if i come back with my family in tow i ' d give palisade a try again a long a they fix the chemical smell , the moldy ceiling issue , the bed and the attitude of the staff . until then i ' ll be stay down the road at cheaper , and in my opinion , better lodging .",0,1095
"the only reason for the one star be the location . close to downtown disney , and the view be perfect . and that be the only good thing about this hotel i choose for my honeymoon ! first , at check in , the clerk be like a robot . didn ' t bother to ask why we be there , just do her speech in a monotone voice . when she mention resort fee , i question . she inform me a long a we use none of the service list , we would get our deposit of $ 250 back . yes , $ 250 on top of the overpriced amount we already pay to stay . ( the rest of this will be finish at the end of the review ) she inform u our room wasn ' t ready , so come back in an hour . long story short , after wait four hour , and another extremely rude clerk who couldn ' t even be bother to look at u , our room be ready . we end our first night at the lobby bar , where we meet earl , the only genuinely nice person we meet at the hotel . a for food , we go to the covington mill for breakfast , and it be awful . i could have go to mcdonalds down the road ( like we do most day ) for le money and better food . we go to benihana for dinner . good food and experience , but we pay $ 100 for two people , for basic meal . the café be greatly overprice . $ 3 . 00 for a mini bag of chip be outrageous . john t ' s bar ( the lobby bar ) be nice , and earl be wonderful , but the rest of our stay the whole place be bombard with so many people , they be trickle into the couch across the way . i would think this be because the `` pool bar '' , be never open . even though it state on their website they be open until 8pm , they be only open once our entire week stay , and it be at noon time . i have stay on property at disney resort more time than i can count , and the earliest i have ever see one close be 9pm . at `` kiddie '' resort . it amaze me that a hotel more geared towards adult than it be child would have their pool bar close . we then dare to try the in room dining , and it again be just awful . we have to leave the food and go eat somewhere else . we didn ' t have it in u to try the italian place at the hotel at that point . the fitness center : half of the machine break with sign on them they be out of order . be not fix our entire stay , and we go every day . room : the bathroom be disgust . i would have rather stay home . there be mold on the wall . the shower head would pound you with one single stream of water . and again , mold on the wall by the shower , and by the mirror . i find a spider in my towelthe pool : one pool happen to be close down for two day due to an `` event '' . the hot tub , although it look beautiful , be break . the jet in one be break and the other that be always pack , the waterfall be break . not to mention the jet on the work one only work for 5 minute interval . the arcade : all of the 10 game they have , half be break . the ground : these be ok , but i do see a few cockroach out in front of the fence by the pool . which be disgustingalso , this place be more of a `` business '' hotel , which they should disclose on their website of some sort . there be drunk men hang around yell while i be out by the pool at night . few of them so drunk and stumble they break glass . those broken cup also stay on the ground , and weren ' t clean up when i leave six day later . when we go to check out , the clerk tell u it be go to be an additional $ 288. when i question her about the resort fee and tell her i be suppose to be reimburse , she inform me that i use the parking which be part of the resort fee . parking , i be tell at check in , be $ 14. so i pay an additional $ 28 for the parking . so all in all , it be not $ 14 a day in park . i pay over $ 40 a day to park . completely unacceptable , because i would have just take cab instead of rent a car if that be the case . plus i pay for one room service meal . ( which be not in dispute ) . on top of it all , they have put a $ 250 hold on my card at check in . ( which mess me all up ) . then , at check out , they take the extra $ 38. then , the next day , they put the full amount back in my account . not know this i check my account , all seem right , so i go to the store . only for my card to get deny because they take it all out again . so they mess up my bank account for day with the keep the money and return it . finally , they take it out and keep it . this be by far the worst hotel i have ever stay in or deal with . and i have be in alot of hotel . i will write hotwire ( who i book with ) , and i will also be write disney to give another review , so they know this hotel be not by any mean hold up to any `` disney '' standard . this place nearly ruin my once in a lifetime honeymoon .",0,1093
"this place can be sum up in one word : overwhelming . the gaylord palm be the first resort i ' ve have the pleasure of visiting , so maybe part of my awe be due to this first- time experience . this hotel be just enormous . they have something like 1 , 100 guest room , two enormous pool , five restaurant on- site , rental car service , shuttle , 24- hour room service . . . you name it , they ' ve get it for you . - the room : lovely , spacious and nicely stock . every guest pay a $ 15 `` resort fee '' each day that allow a few perk , such a a paper deliver to your door , two fresh bottle of water in your room fridge , in- room wireless internet , etc . i would take advantage of that water if i be you , a the water in central florida be uber sulfur- y and not at all delicious . my room have two double bed and the bedding be super comfy and fluffy . down pillow all around ( which i totally appreciate ) and lot of them ( even two extra in the closet ) . really great armoir with tv hidden inside make the room nice and seamless while it be close . there ' s lot of storage space in case you ' re stay awhile and/ or you enjoy unpack your thing from your suitcase . two room bathroom allow for toilet/ shower in one space to be separate from someone else get ready by the twin sink . since i be alone , i didn ' t really care , but i could appreciate this have i be stay with someone . there be a hair dryer and makeup mirror available for people who need that kind of stuff . really nice , fancy smanschy toiletry available ( neutrogena brand ) and they replenish everyday . my favorite part of the room ? the doorbell ! no more knocking , people - you have your own , personal doorbell that have control for `` do not disturb '' and `` please service room '' on your end . so cool ! - the restaurant : there be five restaurant on the actual resort property and i go to three of them . my favorite be villa del flora , which be buffet food all the time . it be a pretty great selection and there be ton to go around so you never felt unsatisfied . they serve breakfast , lunch and dinner so you can always dine at this restaurant . sunset sam ' s fish camp ( locate in the key west area of the resort ) serve a somewhat small menu of seafood item . i wasn ' t too enthral by their selection , so i stick with clam chowder and a caesar salad . both be good , but they really need to get more on that menu ( maybe some shellfish , please ? ! ) . sora be the sushi restaurant on property and even though i didn ' t go , my coworkers say it be good . they apparently have great cocktail , so try one . they look delicious . cantina del sol serve up some nice poolside bar food that be probably my favorite of the entire trip . portabella burger with blue cheese ? yes please ! they have a good selection of drink and this restaurant/ bar serve the poolsides so you can keep replenish while you ' re enjoy yourself outside . i didn ' t go to the old hickory steakhouse , but it look delicious so i recommend you go . i bet it ' s good . - one thing to remember : all of the food/ drink be totally overprice here , so get use to it . some of the stuff isn ' t very good and it still cost $ 14 , but that ' s what you get when you stay at a resort . just make sure you get thing that you know a place can ' t screw up - stick with appetizer and salad if you ' re not sure . - amenity : the pool be fantastic ! there be one pool reserve for guest 18+ , which be awesome . there be a ton of kid at this resort ( which i ' m not a fan of ) so it ' s nice to have a place to go where you ' re not bother by their screaming and generally irritate demeanor . they serve drink poolside until 8 p. m. but the service be slow so beware ! they ' ll charge directly to you or to a room so you have the option . the pool be open until 11 and it ' s a really great place to go to just relax and have a good time . i will admit that the kid ' s pool look pretty awesome , so bring your kid if you have them - they ' ll have a great time at their own family- friendly pool . - there ' s a hertz rent- a- car on site , which be super convenient for those look to take day trip to place other than disney . there ' s a huge outlet mall nearby which seem like a popular destination , so this hertz be pretty busy . - there ' s free shuttle service to/ from the disney property since the gaylord palm be practically locate right inside the magic kingdom ! the shuttle run often and you can reserve directly with the concierge so you don ' t have to do any work at all . - my favorite thing : flight check- in computer in the lobby ! there be two machine and a printer available for you to print your boarding pass for free ! i think more hotel should offer this service and i ' m glad the gaylord palm be on board . - convention center : definitely a well- oiled machine back there . lot of space for all of the meeting we attend and it ' s a lovely facility . stay here for sure if you can . it ' s expensive , but worth it !",1,1084
"ahhh . . . disney world . the most magical place on earth . when i walk onto a disney property , i expect to be dazzle . wow . amaze , charm , awestruck . at the very least : impressed . i expect more from disney . keep that in mind a you read my impression of disney ' s all star movie resort . the standard set by disney so far surpass that of any other hotel/ resort that , if present with anything le than perfection exceed , i would be disappoint . at disney ' s all star music - i be disappoint . this be a disney resort go `` budget. `` i get the impression of a day inn or holiday inn that have be toss into a cuisinart with 30 year of disney history and some bright paint . nothing make this resort stand out from other budget travel motel . the disney all- star movie resort be within disney ' s all- star resort , a complex which include three theme area : sport , music , and movie . they be identical resort , save for the choice of decoration : each be decorate in it respective theme . the room in all- star movie be decorate with film- strip trim on the wall , faux- reel- camera lamp , toy story bedspread and curtains- you get the idea . it ' s disney . check- in be uneventful , a long a you don ' t arrive with an airport bus and 60 passenger . there be no bellman , and your room be a drive rather than a walk from the `` welcome center. `` the desk staff be smile and helpful , and obviously `` disney- trained '' in guest satisfaction . locationdisney ' s all- star resort be closest to disney ' s animal kingdom and disney ' s blizzard beach water park . also nearby be downtown disney feature pleasure island with it plethora of nightclub , and various shopping and din area . the all star resort be a bit off the beaten path . the `` novice disney- er '' might feel lose here . pricei pay $ 54. for that price , these resort be definitely acceptable . i do later find out that upgrade to a disney `` moderate '' resort add only $ 20 nightly to my rate . next time , i might try a `` moderate '' disney property , such a disney ' s carribbean beach resort or disney ' s port orleans resort . amenitiesfor a `` budget '' hotel , these resort be a step above the norm . the service be impeccably disney . everyone be smile and ( almost disturbingly ) chipper . request for more pillow , blanket , and towel be all meet with a chirpy `` yes of course ! ! ! ! `` most room come with 2 double bed , a small dresser with tv on top , and the usual window- ac . the vanity with sink , hair dryer , hand towel and washcloth be in the back of the room . room do not have closet , rather a `` closet bar '' in the room for hang clothing . there be no refrigerator . i believe they be offer for an additional charge . the bathroom be small and the vanity be in the room . the decor varies from theme to theme , typically colorful- disney- esque bedspread which match the curtain and the wall border . i would call the room adequate . they be clean , well- stock , and easily accessible from the parking lot . but they be on the small side of the scale . the pool be numerous and busy at all time . surprisingly the noise level be not unbearable . the drink at poolside be expensive a expect , but not too shabby for resort- style frou- frou drink . the foodi have find , with the exception of some of the epcot world showcase restaurant , that food be not walt disney world ' s prime concern . the food find at the all star resort ' food court be no different . mass- produce and overprice . they offer pizza , burger and hot dog , chicken , and some hot entree a well . ( i notice mainly italian selections. ) i do not eat any of this food : a at most theme park , i stay away from the food offer through the resort , and i prefer to dine on international drive in orlando , or in old towne in kissimme . the transportationah . walt disney world transportation . it seem that this be the one area that disney have just not master . ( see my upcoming review on disney transportation. ) i will just say that ( theoretically ) disney provide guest air condition transport ( via bus and monorail ) from it resort to all of it theme park , water park , and shopping/ dining complex . the bus pick up guest of specific resort at designate bus station and return guest to their resort . if it ever work , it would be a great system . my recommendation : drive yourself . guest at disney resort enjoy free parking at all disney park . in closingi have no specific complaint about the cleanliness , staff , or general facility . it ' s just that , in my opinion , disney have an earn and well deserved reputation for be a `` notch above average. `` it just didn ' t seem to me that the `` budget travel '' genre fit in with that lavish , opulent disney image . this be not mean to be a `` bad '' review , but not a `` great '' one either . if the price be much lower than the competition , i would stay at disney ' s all- star resort again . i just prefer and expect a bit more catering- to and luxury when i ' m stay at a disney property .",1,1044
"this be likely the highest rating i will give to a hotel in a decade . that be not to say that this be the `` best '' hotel on an absolute scale - - i have stay at much more luxurious hotel by , obviously pay a lot more money . this hotel get the highest score because at slightly le than 100 dollar per night , it make a difficult plan work out perfectly . i be with my child for a trip dedicate to disney , universal and sea world . it be understandable why i do not also want to deal with a car . the fact that we be here for more than just disney be significant , because that be why we do not want to stay at a disney resort which make go to other place intentionally difficult ( and i be a budget traveler too ) . a stroke of good fortune , my wife ( who could not be with u on the trip ) find this hotel that provide free shuttle to all the park we want to go to . because the space here ( or anywhere , let me know if i be wrong ) can not handle the full length review i write in word , i have to break it into many piece and post at different place . for a detailed review of the shuttle service , please see ( ) . but the bottom line be that the shuttle work , very well . so best western - - continue to keep your driver happy because this be a huge boost for your hotel . the shuttle be a key to our plan , but i would not have give the hotel such a great score for just the shuttle . the other review i read before i book be right - - the inn keeper be nice , very nice . i would like to single out one gentleman , derek , who be not just chatty nice , but who go out of his way to give stress , exhaust traveler a genuine gesture of care and kindness . he make this otherwise lackluster chain a unique place , the first hotel ( after have travel through 3 continent ) that i feel a personal attachment toward - - a home away from home . a a matter of fact , i feel compel to write a thoughtful review ( which my busy schedule usually keep me from do ) because of derek - - i would feel terrible if i do not give derek credit . on our departure day , i be run into some expect conundrum travel with multiple child , and derek let u check out late a need , with no fuss , all smile . best western - - you be fortunate to have derek , and i bet that you do not pay him enough , so give it some thought . almost all the other people be very nice too . ally , and the gentleman that always work the same shift a her , be great at recommend restaurant within walk distance . the restaurant be not a great a the hotel , but again , have them within 100 step be key to our plan ( shiraz grill be good but overpriced , village inn be nothing special food- wise but a good price and friendly ) . the hotel breakfast staff be surprisingly attentive - - maybe the goal be so guest would not make a big mess of the waffle maker , but we all appreciate the waffle come our way automatically . i befriend a lady that live in taiwan for many year , and the next thing i know she be rescue me when my daughter spill a whole cup of hot chocolate . the breakfast item do not all taste great - - the waffle and pancake look great but taste artificial . but my assessment be that it be not a lack of effort , just reasonable limitation of budget and choice of equipment . after all , the breakfast be free and on- site ( again key to catch the morning shuttle ) , there be a decent espresso machine ( though my wife would say my opinion can only be amateur ) , and fresh fruit , yogurt , toast and scramble egg be all very acceptable . i know i be break the record for length of a single review , but i want to write a review that i wish be there before i go on this trip . so while it be not directly about the hotel , it be directly about the kind of trip that i think this hotel be perfect for . first of all , if you be pay about the same price for each park ( $ 100 a piece ) , skip sea world . i will post the detail directly on yelp/ sea world because again i be cut down by the word limit here . second , disney park hopper be a waste of money , unless you buy 5 day or more ( because by then the average price per day dip down ) ( yelp/ epcot ) . third , universal ticket window staff be incredibly high pressure in sell u the two- park ticket , and scornful ( in front of my kid ) when i refuse . my advice : refuse him ( yelp/ universal studio ) so for anyone travel on budget , not drive , with the goal to hit the best of orlando for young first- time goer in a relatively short time ( a long a you be energetic and excite about fun pack plan ) , here be my advice a well a my future plan : stay at best western plus orlando , day 1 magic kingdom stay for firework , day 2 epcot must stay for the best firework and buy souvenir here after park close , day 3 universal studio and day 4 fly back relatively early .",1,1037
"thanks to a great rate deal for season pas holder , we take advantage of the opportunity to stay at the top end of the three on- site hotel at the universal resort . overall , the choice be well worth it . the hotel have a lot go for it . the room we stay it be quite large and the bed be extremely comfortable . the view we have of the `` bay '' be quite pleasant and the curtain do an excellent job of block out light when we want it dark in the room to sleep . the staff at all level - front desk , luggage storage , housekeeping , everyone , be pleasant and extremely helpful . the overall property itself be dramatic and they go to great effort to try to bring the feel of italy over to the resort . there be two main pool area . the big pool be set up like a beach and have both a `` zero depth '' section a well a the deeper part that go down to about five foot . this deeper section have a somewhat donut shape to it and in the middle there be the exit for a sizable water slide that be a lot of fun . this area also have a ping pong table , a pool table ( bring some $ 1 ' s for that one ) , a well a two hot tub and the splendido bar . there be also three cabana available to rent in this area . we enjoy several afternoon break from our park touring in this area . the food available from the bar be adequate and pricey a you would expect for a hotel . drink be also pricey , but well prepared . i do find the service from the rove waitstaff to be on the slow side , though . one afternoon , the kid just want to hang out in the room , so my wife and i take the opportunity to check out the other pool area . this be a more conventional pool where you can swim lap and it be also generally a lot quieter and more laid back than the other pool . wait staff come through frequently and you can get drink and food from the bar for this pool a well . i generally find the staff at this pool to be better than the one at the other pool . i also notice that this pool have at least a dozen cabana to rent . this pool area also have it own hot tub and change room with locker . overall , it make for a nice retreat area to take a break in . there be a couple of major perk to stay at one of the on- site hotel that we take advantage of each day . first , on- site guest get in an extra hour early to the island of adventure park to access the harry potter section . the big ride there `` forbidden journey '' have no express pas line and the queue will build up quickly . by the time the regular guest be let in for full park opening , the wait will already be between 50- 70 minute . the other major perk be the unlimited `` express pas '' that on- site guest get . most of the ride at universal feature an `` express pas '' line that bypass the main wait . often time , we be able to walk on to a particular ride while the main line have 30- 60 minute wait . typically , even on busy day , you ' ll have le than 15 minute in an express pas queue . if you be go to the park during a busy time , the express pas perk will help you make the most of your stay and do greatly help me justify the extra expense of stay at an on- site hotel . it ' s not a perfect place , and some of these be more thing that you just need to be aware of , rather than purely `` bad '' thing about the hotel : first , because the resort be design to mimic and italian town , the hotel be rather short and very spread out . depend on where your room be , you can be in for a lot of walk down long hallway to get back and forth from your room . there be also a lot of walk potential on the property itself get to the pool , front desk , and boat dock area . which bring up the other thing to consider with this one - portofino be farthest away from the two park . there be a boat system that universal run to move guest from the resort to the park . however , the trip time for portofino be the longest and if they be only run one boat , it can take 20 minute between trip and we have a few case where the line have too many people to fit on a boat . though , to their credit , i do notice that during high period , they would run two boat , so that help . finally , my one big complaint regard the room be that they do not come with a refrigerator or microwave . if available , you can rent them for $ 15/ day each ! from what i could see , this be the case for all three of the on- site hotel . it be certainly disappointing to find hotel in this price range omit these kind of amenity , though it also seem to be all to common a well . still , whenever i be at a hotel that lack these room feature , i call them out on it . i know this in advance at least , and plan around it . overall , i would definitely stay again if i plan another extend universal trip .",1,1030
"shade of green get 4 star because of the freebie that come along with it . if not it would get 3 star . i ' m go to try to hit everything but it wont be in any order . we will definitely be back to sog next time . pro and con : 1. shade of green be military and dod only so you win ' t have to deal with the general public . most military family be respectful and realize that everyone want piece and quiet . this be say , it have a very mwr feel to the whole place . 2. transportation to and from the park . every 20 minute to epcot and magic kingdom . every hour to the other park . the bad side of that , if you take trans to the other park you ' ll be wait about 45 minute for a bus that only come once an hour unless you take another way home . 3. security at this place might a well mimic a military base . this get to be annoy . show an id to get back on the bus , drive anywhere and they want an id to get back into the hotel park area . this be really the only thing that i didn ' t like about sog . maybe if they be actually check your id i wouldn ' t be annoy but just look at it quickly and say ok isn ' t security . it ' s one or the other . the door that lead from the park deck to the hotel be never lock either . . 4. on site dining . there be several place to eat on ground and pretty reasonable . we only eat at the italian place for lunch one day and the express cafe for breakfast another . expensive but way better than eating in the park . i spend $ 8 on a muffin , banana and a water . then again it be florida , and cost of living in orlando be a little more than where i live , just south of atlanta . 5. the staff- cleaning staff be pretty good . i usually don ' t want them clean our room but they still ask every day . front desk staff be a expect from any hotel . our shower handle break on day 2 and they send the maintenance guy immediately . i have just enough time to take the elevator to my 4th floor room and walk in before he be knock to fix the shower . 6. vend slim to non existent . every floor have a ice machine and some have coke machine . there be a snack machine in the laundry room , but some douche ' clog the change port with penny so we couldn ' t use it . 7. the shopette `` px '' close at a normal time and room service stop at 12am . if you come back from extra magic hour at 1am you have two choice : go to bed hungry or drive off property to the nearest mcdonalds ( 8 mile away ) . 8. location . this be a double edged sward . it ' s great be within walk distance of epcot and magic kingdom ' s parking lot . the bad part be , you be away from everything . the good part be you be away from everything . 9. room size and cost- from what i ' ve see the room you get at sog be what you ' d expect at an average hotel like a jameson inn or ramada . we only pay $ 89 a night for our room since i ' m an e- 5. the room at the other place on property be start at 400+ a night . 10. park fee ! - a lot of place be start this now . sog charge $ 5 a night to park in the parking deck . they offer no security or amenities it ' s just a parking deck . no valet park . quite annoy see a they didn ' t mention it when check in . i , however , be smart enough to real yelp and already know about it . 11. ticket line . let me start off by say , they do email me and let me know i could have buy my ticket ahead of time and have them wait for me at check in . i didn ' t take advantage . the ticket line be bad . you may have 5 people in front of you , but in a very orlando fashion , the cashier move at a snail ' s pace . it take me 45 minute to buy our ticket and there be only about 8- 10 family in front of me . maybe it ' s just me , i come from atlanta where everything and everyone be in a hurry . 12. the check in- i read the horror story about room not be ready so my wife and i purposely arrive at about 5 or 6 pm on the day of check in . we didn ' t have any issue with our room be ready . 13. no microwave ! ! ! ! ! this be how they get you to eat on property . be far away from everything and you can ' t have leftover . . unless you ' ve be in the military long enough to think outside the box . i ' m just say that hair dryer they give you make a pretty good way to heat your food back up at 2am . haall that be say we will be back again . this be our first stay with sog and win ' t be our last unless i find a better deal . every place have it issue and sog be no different . most of the bad thing be petty and easily overlook .",1,1025
"i book this place because it be incredibly cheap suite and centrally locate . i read a ton of review and i can attest that you do get what you pay for . it be a seriously run down hotel and i be prepare to deal with it but i didn ' t realize what i really get into . it do have it pro but ultimately i wouldn ' t go back and wouldn ' t recommend it . i come in with really low expectation from the review , keep in mind . 1. hotel ' s transportation , provide by nixon ? i call ten day in advance to reserve pick up from the airport . the lady , with a hispanic accent ( if you happen to get her on the phone ) say it be book and to pay on the day of . we get to the airport in orlando at 5 : 35am . 6am roll by and 6 : 15 i call their number with no answer . i call the hotel and they help me figure out that they have no record of the reservation and that they will call me back to arrange pick up . i get a call 5 minute later from the same lady who answer me over a week ago , however this time she seem annoyed and snappy on the phone which prompt me to escalate to snappy annoyance a well a i just get off the red eye and be stand outside for close to an hour . the say they be there in 15- 20 minute to pick u up . 30 to 40 minute later we decide to just take a taxi , which end up be cheaper ! nixon charge $ 50 for pick up but for my party of 8 be $ 70ish . our taxi shuttle be $ 68. we wait almost two hour at the airport . . . 2. checking in . it be a reoccurring theme during my stay that the front desk girl be just kind of spacey ( not try to be rude , it seem like some be new ) . while wait to check in , a current guest come up to the desk to complain to the desk that his room be dirty and that the door handle be break and a few other thing he mention that i couldn ' t translate from spanish . they kind of give him the run around that they would send housekeep to clean it but then say housekeeping be close . don ' t know how that be resolve . our room be ok , clean enough . i expected worse but please when i saw them . ( apparently they have a grading system on their room that they assign. ) 3. the room . one of the lock on the bath room door be break , no big deal . second night , we come back from a long day out and find one of the bedroom flood with water and the carpet be soak wet between the bed and bathroom . bathroom fixture be completely dry and shut off so we have no idea where the water come from . they send maintenance , who be completely useless . he keep ask u how do it flood and how to fix it . how should we know ! ultimately , the `` maintenance '' guy say just put some towel on it . we call desk a 2nd time and they try to send maintenance again even though he be already their . we want to request a new room but i can ' t describe the confusing : misunderstanding between u and the front desk . we hang up and just decide to go down and ask in person since all they keep try to do on the phone be send maintenance . we get to the desk and tell them we be from room this and that and the girl instantly just say `` ok , no problem , we get it '' or something like that and grab our room key and make a few copy of them and hand it back . we ' re totally confused and try to explain why we be there . i literally can ' t describe weirdness of what happen , they just start move like chicken with their head cut off and wouldn ' t really let u talk or explain to them a they just go on auto pilot . i get the feeling they go on auto pilot deal with lot of complaint . anyways , we get our new room , which be comparable . 4. new room , one bed be a actual real bed , which be nice . all the rest , in our new and old room be hard flat thin mattress . the couch bed be really run down and dirty . they run out of blanket in the hotel , but to be fair we use like four in our old room just to cover the sofa bed . i sleep in the room with two twin bed . one of the wall by the window literally have booger smear on the wall ! ! ! booger ! and a grain of rice ! ! ! and something unidentifiable ! ! ! 5. breakfast be good . some how at check in , before any problem start we get upgraded to hot breakfast instead of continental . but i think they be practically upgrade everyone to hot breakfast , they try to upgrade u again when we report the flood in our room . i will say breakfast be their biggest upside along with their location and shuttle transportation to universal . 6. beware of them try to off a free or discount pirate show , it a timeshare trap . this be a horrible review but it ' s very true and un- exaggerated . i truly hope it improve .",0,1022
"just get back from an excellent trip to universal . we pick cabana bay because my girlfriend be obsess with the 50 and 60 . this resort live up to the hype of their vintage/ retro/ kitsch look and feel . it didn ' t hurt that this be the cheapest resort at universal either . pro : - essential staff be very helpful and nice . we stay 2 night while plan to do 3 day at the park . for our first day , the plan be to arrive in the morning and check our bag at the luggage counter , hit the park and come back later for our key . the front desk be able to give u a room at 9 : 00am , no problem . check in be list at 4pm . we be so surprised and happy , it kick off our day on such a high note be able to freshen up and get ready for the park in our room and be able to go right back to it later without wait . the guy at the luggage desk be super nice and friendly , too . - the shuttle be fantastic . we never wait more than 2 minute for it leave the resort , and no more than 5 minute get on one at the park ( and it be only because we leave a the studio park close , along with everyone else ) . it be about a 15 minute trip from our room to the gate of the park . you can ' t beat that . - you do get early admission with your room key . very nice add bonus . you can also have purchase merchandise deliver to your hotel for you . it be wait for u at the luggage desk later that even . - they have two great pool area , complete with a water slide at one and a lazy river at the other . head up , you have to purchase the tube at the lazy river ( no rental option ) . we now own two crappy pool tube because we want to use the lazy river for 20 minute . the guy work the booth be nice enough to inflate say tube , and then he take our used one back in exchange for deflated new one , so no issue with get them home . we very much enjoy the pool and pool side bar . the drink be great and actually pretty strong . despite what the posted sign suggest , people be drink in the pool and hot tub , so we do too and have no issue with the staff . everyone we saw do it , ourselves include , be clean and respectful about it though . - we love the on- site starbucks which we use every day , and we eat at the bayview diner once ( an open- style food court with many option for hot and cold food , plus dessert and snack ) . i prefer my half chicken with potato from the grill a oppose to my girlfriend ' s burger and fry . we unfortunately do not get to bowl at galaxy bowl or check out the restaurant up there , so i can ' t share any info on it . - we have a double bed room since king room be sell out and more expensive , but it be plenty enough space for the two of u . bed be full size , not queen . comfortable bed and pillow , with light bed and no allergy problem ( i sometimes have issue with feather bedding ) . this be apparently throughout the hotel so this may be a great choice for those of you with allergy problem . there be a small fridge hide in the tv stand/ dresser for those who want to keep food and drink in the room . big plus . sink and mirror on the outside of the bathroom also make get ready in the morning go much faster . con ( all very minor ) : - i can ' t speak to the size of a king room or suite , but the double bed room we stay in be tight . plenty of space for just u two , but i could have see there be an issue if we be travel with another couple . four people in the double bed room will be tight . there be not a lot of open floor space for multiple suitcase . we pack light with just duffle , but if you plan to have 4 people and 4 suitcase in the double bed room , be prepare to trip over one another . - we receive a first floor room , so we didn ' t have much of a view . our window face a parking lot . thankfully , we didn ' t hear any noise from outside and really not much from inside the hotel . i don ' t think this place be sound- proofed , so maybe we be just on a quiet floor . either way , no noise issue , but i would have love a view of the pool . - gift shop have a very limited amount of cabana bay merchandise . we want to pick up one of the galaxy bowl bowling shirt but they be out of medium and large . only one t- shirt for guy , and it be aqua blue/ green . a few girl tee and a sweatshirt , but not much to pick from . a we be fan of the resort and it style/ design , we want to get some gift - sadly , there just weren ' t many choice . all in all , we love stay at cabana bay and would stay again next time universal get a new attraction and we want to come back . i recommend check out",1,1020
"two of my friend and i stay at the cypress point grande villa resort from december 30 , 2011 to january 6th 2012. during our stay at this time share property we experience so many issue that on the last two day of our vacation , the only thing we want be to go back home . we do not want to spend one more day at the place but we have already make the huge mistake of pay our stay up front . the first thing we notice be that the person who rent the unit to u , jim , do not provide an accurate description of the place he have advertise on the flipkey website and in subsequent email . for example he tell me that the place be big enough for up to five people , that be false because there be three of u in the unit and we felt cramp and crowd . he also tell me that there be a jacuzzi in the room but in reality what we have be a tub and a shower separate . jim also tell me that there be a washer and dryer in the room but that be no accurate either . we also find out that the resort do not offer housekeep service until the seventh day of our stay . this particular detail be very interesting to me take into consideration that we get a call the morning after our arrival , ask u to attend a time share presentation . it do not make sense to me that if a resort be try to promote it unit to new guest the first thing they do be make them feel uncomfortable by not offer housekeep . so , we say ok. . . this be not what we expect . we think that our surprise with the place will end there but we be wrong because for the first 3 night of our stay we be not able to sleep past 9 : 00 be because that be time when the housekeeping people start make lot of noise ( drag stuff and shout ) on the hallway and on the unit above u . the first two day we tolerate it because we think it be a transitory thing but we be wrong because the issue continue . on the morning of january 1st i decide to get up and go talk to the housekeep person make noise on the unit above u . when i tell her if it be possible to make le noise because we be still sleep , she seem surprised and tell me that this be the way the cleaning be do . i turn back , go back to the suite , texted jim , to inform him about the situation . he say that he be sorry to hear that and that he have not experience this issue before . he say he be go to tell the manager about it when he see him . i do not know when that be go to happen because at that moment he be texting from another state . this be not very helpful , a you can imagine . then he ask me if i be have a good weather in sedona . that be really confuse to me because i be in orlando , not in sedona . he then explain he get confused because he also rent time share in sedona . we be so disappointed at that point that the only thing we want be to get a refund and go somewhere else , so i ask for it but he tell me he could not get a refund and suggest i contact the manager myself , so i could get a resolution to the noise situation . at that moment i realize i be not go to get any practical help from jim , so i dress up and go to the front desk with one of my friend . i ask for the manager but the front desk person tell me he be not there and ask me to return later . i take the manager business card from the front desk and call him he answer promptly , so i explain my frustration with the situation . he immediately offer me a potential solution to the problem by offer me an upgrade to a two bedroom suite on a different location of the same building . he say he would be send the key to me soon . immediately after finish my conversation we start pack and move to the other room . we think we will finally be able to stay late in bed that the rest of our stay at the place would be perfect , but we be wrong once again because that night the temperature drop to the low 20 and when we try to turn the heating system we realize that it be not work . we call the front desk and they promptly send a maintenance person , who after take a look at the unit tell u that there be a damage piece that need to be replace and that nothing could be do until next morning . he offer to lend u an electric heater so we do not feel so cold during the night . we really appreciate his offer because the temperature be very cold and be predict to remain like that at least for one more day . he say he would return next day around 10 : 00 be to fix the unit . next morning around 11 : 00 be , the maintenance person have not arrive , so we go back to the front desk once again , this time very upset . we tell precious , the front desk person , that we be really feed up with the whole situation at the place and that we do not want to be there anymore . not enough space . . . yenny",0,1015
"there be lot of thing to like about this hotel , but alot of the trimming around the edge detract from the overall experience . my husband have a conference in orlando last week . we come over to disney for 2 day afterwards a a treat . i want to stay at the polynesian , but he want the contemporary because of it iconic appeal . so , contemporary it be . i find the sound suppression of the hotel pretty good . we be on the 10th floor . when you get off the elevator to your floor , the background noise of the monorail be pretty loud . however , upon enter the room , you can ' t tell there be a restaurant and a monorail on the other side . the bed be comfortable and we have a nice view of the water and the pool area . the water view be good because we could watch the water parade at night . i also enjoy the food at this hotel . we eat at both the wave and california grill but those review be locate elsewhere . i do rather enjoy have giftshops and other thing downstairs to poke around at the end of the night . the shop be well stock . . . one of the shop even have a small grocery section to pick up some peanut butter , jelly or campbell ' s soup . i have go to disney several time over the last 20 year . i have only stay on property once before and that be at one of the all star property about 10- 15 year ago . i have to say , stay at a place with the monorail service make life easier . you pay for the premium , but it really take alot of the hassle out of the day to just walk down and catch a train rather than drive over for parking . when we be tire , we just hop on the monorail and be back at the hotel . the location and convenience of this hotel make it a good experience . however , there be several aspect of this hotel that detract from the overall vacation experience . first , i don ' t think the elevator be large enough or numerous enough to accomodate the number of guest . if you want to get an elevator when the hotel isn ' t busy , it no problem . if you try to do so around the time the park open , dinner time , or when the park close , be prepare to wait . i really like the carpet and exterior trimming of the hotel , but i think it be in need of an update . the door lock be probably about 15- 20 year old now and be a little twitchy . you have to be patient with them , and i know from other place i ' ve stay the one they use be pretty outdated for 2010. i be also le than impress with the cleanliness of the trimming . the room ( sheet , towel , floor ) be clean . i be a bit icked out when i would pick up various thing set out in the room for either decor or perusal . the decor have half scrap off price on it ( huh ? ) and the thing set out to read have old dried kernel of food on it . yes , i understand these room have a frequent turnover , but i don ' t like to pick up a piece of advertisement and see a bit of flatten bread , crumb or other crap on it . disney be suppose to be all about illusion and i want to pretend i ' m the first user of this room . i don ' t like to see previous remnant around . we pay more for this room than almost any other one we ' ve ever stay at and i expect it to be clean . i ' ve stay in red roof ' s that be cleaner on the trimming and i really don ' t expect much at those place beyond a bed and a place for my doggie ( no , she didn ' t come with u here ) . the last thing i be unhappy with be the bathroom . when i walk in the room , i be le than happy with the bathroom immediately . the husband tell me it wasn ' t that bad , but after 2 day he agree that it be not all that great . the bathroom be do in marble tile . perhaps nice for 1991 , but nowadays , it be show it wear ( or at least the grout be ) . the shower head be old and need to be soak in a hard water solution to remove the mineral . the waterflow go in a couple different direction and it just look old . the worst be the sink . they put in the super contemporary ( yeah , i get the pun , but it what come to mind ) sink that be very large . two large flat sink dominate that area with a small ( think 6 inch by 6 inch ) area between them for your toiletry . they intend to have you place everything under the sink , but it be just awkward and irritate . i keep all my toiletry out in the room because it be easier . the large flat sink don ' t drain exceptionally well and the space would have be better allocate for a place to set your thing out . overall , it be okay and give the location , i may stay here again in the future . i ' ll be cross my finger for a room update though .",0,1006
"cripes , what on earth happen to the hilton hotel chain ? ! after a recent visit to hilton ' s orlando/ altamonte spring location , it ' s plain to see that their former high level of service and prestige have drop faster than kim kardashian ' s panty during a filming of snoop dogg ' s xxx rat `` doggy style '' film series . before i launch into the bulk of this review like one of wernher von braun ' s v- 2 combat rocket of wwii , i wish to add for the record , that i do not stay the night in this particular establishment . it be my uncle who , while visit for my great aunt ' s birthday , book a reservation with his daughter for the evening . my review encompass only what i witness a an direct observer while inside the hotel . to start , the ground of the hotel on the exterior appear well- kept though , i be mystify by the very odd and rather creepy look statue that apparently be randomly place out front and within . more on these later . i have drive my uncle and his daughter from the airport to this establishment , pull into the parking lot only to find the entire lot pack tighter than charles barkley ' s waistband , pre- weight watcher . i actually saw some other traveler attempt to park their hummer into the tiny space and it also mark the first time i saw a parking space acquire stretch mark . a we walk together through the automatic double- door , we all remark on the incredible noise level . there be quite literally herd and herd of middle school boy and girl , supposedly on some sort of a school prom or formal , run through the lobby and the adjacent bar a if in the event they didn ' t reach their destination quickly , their carriage would turn back into a pumpkin . what fairy god mother in fresh hell release this tidal force of rambunctious , rag hormone- driven teenager upon the customer of the local hilton hotel ? ! seriously , what be up with these kid ? ! i saw a couple of young female teen actually stand at the bar , their back arch and posterior stick outward a if to insinuate the `` welcome '' mat be out . the male be no better , lurk around the various surround pillar among the shadow , do their best james dean impression and also attempt to put out the vibe near the bar . why be they even allow in this area ? ! also , their outfit be ridiculous , no matter what the function happen to be ! one young boy rush pass me wear a purple velour suit ( complete with tail and a top hat ) , chase after a girl of a similar age . be this kid go to a school dance or conduct a magic show ? doves up his sleeve ? never- end handkerchief from his breast pocket ? lord only know what he intend to pull out of his hat ! i hope his date run far , far away if he offer to show her his magic wand . in any case , he can thank his parent that he be now scar for life a no doubt , image of him wear that suit be soon to be firmly plant in e- mail , circulate by unknowing family member and on social website like facebook for all the mass ' amusement . now , if only his parent have name the poor kid `` dick '' . it ' s also worth note that the carpet design on the various floor be comprise of wildly fiery color and mind- altering design . i find them to be eerily reminiscent of those find in casino . be we check in to our room or open up a crap table ? c ' mon , lucky seven ! after change , i join my uncle in the concierge ' s lounge for drink , fruit plate and hot dish . just a we seat ourselves near the wall to dine on a gourmet serving of crispy cheese stick and warm , wilt salad , the serve area be bombard with more rowdy teenager , who have just come from the pool , wear only their soaked bathing suit and drip all over the floor and the serving station . there be no staff present to clean their mess or to send them back to their room to change into attire more fitting for the atmosphere . be this really hilton ' s idea of what a concierge ' s lounge should be ? whoever say this be a true concierge ' s lounge be full of more crap than a whale with no as ! one young girl run to a table of about 8 older individual , complain that she be sick from a milk product she have recently consume near the pool and then proceed to throw up behind a chair . dear god ! walk back to the floor ' s atrium , i notice a statue of ghastly look figure that seem to stare right at you a you wait for the elevator to arrive . they be not attractive at all and i sincerely believe that they come alive during the night and hunt you down the hallway . you better sleep with one eye open at this hilton because you ' re dead from now on ! a an observer , i give this hilton 3 star for the clean , quiet room but i dock 2 star for the rowdiness that be prevalent throughout the establishment and the lack of attention to detail . also , those statue look like `` child of the corn ! ``",0,1005
"my mother and i stay at the wyndham lake buena vista resort this summer . it be my first ever trip to disney , and i actually be here a part of a conference . the conference cover two night of my stay , and i cover my two night vacation . i stay in the tower room , and the two night with tax cost me $ 200 total . the tower room be worth the slightly higher cost ! ! ! book the tower room only . they be only an extra $ 10 per night . we be on the 17th or 18th floor and have an amazing view . the hotel be a bit old , run- down , and not clean very well . it wasn ' t dirty by any stretch , but i think there be some improvement to be make . some of the front desk be great and some very snarky . when i check in , the girl i check in with call the room to make sure everything be good . appreciate . but overall , this be below the wyndham standard . with four day in this hotel , i saw a lot . here be my insight ! food option at the hotel : - poolside bar : not very good . we be starve after fly and stop here . we order a burger and an order of fried shrimp . they both come with a side of nacho , and be just over $ 10 a piece . the burger be decent , and i think it have bacon and cheese . it be pretty good but very greasy . the shrimp be gross . it be mostly breading and so salty . bad bad bad . the nacho be ok. - convenience market- a you enter the hotel , there be a grab and go market . it be very overpriced , but it be convenient a you leave the park and be hungry at 1 be . we get italian sub that be a bit soggy here but passable a well a a personal cheese pizza that be ok. it ' s go to run you about $ 10/ snack here a well . the coffee and pastry stand look nice , though . - breakfast buffet/ character breakfast- i don ' t remember the exact rate here , a it be part of my conference . however , i really enjoy this buffet , and i would pay $ 15/ head to come back if i be hungry . there be a large yogurt parfait station , omelette station , pre- make egg and breakfast meat , a large fruit bar , plenty of bread , and pizza or mac and cheese . the pizza and mac and cheese be weird for breakfast but good . goofy and pluto come to our character breakfast , and they be super nice ! ! you get a lot of time with the character because this breakfast doesn ' t get too too crowded . the regular breakfast day this place be a ghost town . i really enjoy my breakfast , though . disney theme park and disney thing : - this hotel , along with two other hotel , share a bus shuttle to the four disney park . we take bus to both magic kingdom and animal kingdom from the hotel , and we be on the first bus of the day both time . the bus be not pack at these time , and the director of fun , jill , make sure to explain the bus system to get back a well . at night , the bus be pack . we lucked out and get on both time , but do realize that you may not get on the bus , and the bus only run every half hour . bus be on time in our experience . - do remember that this hotel be right by downtown disney ! if you can ' t get on a wyndham bus , take a downtown disney bus and just cross the street to get to the wyndham . - it be a five to ten minute walk to downtown disney from here ! the traffic light to cross the road be very slow , but there be currently an overpass be construct so that you can cross over the road . it will be a five minute walk once that be build . - you can get discount disney ticket through the expedia agent here , a well a restaurant discount . you be able to purchase a 2 pm to close and 4 pm to close ticket , which be perfect if you get into the hotel early in the morning ! hotel related things- the conference space be very small , but fairly nice . some room didn ' t have window , though , which i do not like . - the pool area be large . there be one kiddie pool that be shallow and have a large play structure in the center . there be another pool off of that one with a large- rock waterfall structure . separate from both of those pool be a standard pool that be nice to sit out by and a good temperature . the pool be not heat , but it definitely do not need to be by late may . personally , i would totally stay here again , if the tower room remain the same price . would i prefer to stay in a disney resort ? absolutely , but this be 1/ 4 of the price . i might look at the other hotel in lake buena vista , but this one do have a prime location .",1,983

"my party of 6 include 2 toddler and 2 grandparent stay here over the 2015/ 2016 holiday for almost a week . our trip be last minute ( book the same month ) and this be one of the only resort leave that be still semi- reasonably price for an orlando holiday . i be kind of scared after read review but we have a perfect vacation at liki tiki and would stay here time and time again . there be a ton of planned activity , but we didn ' t get to participate in them . our updated room request be grant at check- in for a room near the kiddie pool . it be small , quiet , and even though it be the holiday , no one else be there during our time . we be very happy with our room and the fact that we be far away from the main pool that be noisy . i would say our stay be on the marriott level a far a hotel quality go which be what we pay for and expect . check- in : go smooth at just before 4pm without a hitch . apparently some people have try to check in early and be give some type of form to come back at 4pm to pick up a key ( or wait for a phone call when their room be ready ) . at 4 , i be second in line but the line be quickly 5- 6 people deep . it go fast , and i be very happy that when a woman try to cut in line `` to just ask a question '' ( when in actuality she want her room key ) the lady at the desk kindly send her ( marisol ) to the back of the line where she belong . i can ' t stand it when people think their `` situation '' be more press than the long line of people wait in front of them . grounds/ pool : all be well keep . we love the quiet pool option and the option of the bigger pool . my only issue be that people very obviously leave their thing at the large pool all day reserve the best spot even though they aren ' t there . we be in the kiddie pool area with limited table for more than a few hour , and 3 table have towel and bag but not a single person sit in the chair for those 3+ hour . it ' d be nice if people be more courteous or the sign say `` no reserving '' be enforce ( but i have yet to find a resort that do enforce this ) . we be able to get a table though so this didn ' t worry u , but i could see a situation where people be rude enough to go to disney all day and reserve pool table for when they return . nasty ! restaurant : we all eat at the restaurant one day and if we ' d stay longer would ' ve eat there many more time . the staff be wonderful and the food be great . we have a pretzel ( best i ever have , i know it ' s crazy to say that ) , wing , drink , and a chicken quesadilla . all be delicious and fresh , any extra be quickly grant by the staff even though they be swamp . it do take awhile for the wing , but i notice that they be bombard with pick- up and pool order before we place the wing order so at least our food be fresh . room : we couldn ' t have ask for better . right off of the kiddie pool with a view from our balcony . it be upgrade with a nice flooring , granite , modern everything include kitchen cabinet and divide suite with flat screen in every room . my father in law even get idea for a house he be build from look at the suite . i think the decoration inside the room be very nice also . a far a noise , we do hear kid run for 5 minute one evening , but we have small kid so i can ' t imagine the noise ours make . also , when we first walk in we hear someone talk through the door for the joined suite next door , but we didn ' t hear them again after that . it do sound like they be right there for a minute . timeshare hassle : my husband go to get the parking pas and say a few no ' s be not an issue . someone do call our room a couple of time but we barely notice and already know not to answer . we get a flyer under our door for a presentation and that be it . i actually didn ' t see it until the last day because we might ' ve attend just to get the offer . overall , we have a blast at liki tiki and can not wait to go back . we didn ' t even do the putt putt golf or other amenity . from check in to check out , we be highly impressed and we have stay in resort in mexico , dominican republic , arizona , jamaica , puerto rico , st lucia , and other place . .",1,936
"do you own something nice ? avanti resort be probably go to attempt to steal it from you . if there be a way to give this hotel the middle finger all the way from where i be i would , but unfortunately my 1 star review will have to do . i ' ll get the positive out of the way - there be a bed , and you be able to sleep on it . also , it wasn ' t way overprice . usually when i be travel for my show that be all that i care about , but avanti resort really push my button here . on my day leave , i be charge an extra $ 25 for a resort fee ( i suppose the bed aren ' t part of the resort ? ) that ' s probably not a big deal , i mean , there be a lot of amenity ( that you will never use ) . but the thing that piss me off the most ? get ready folk , and try to imagine you be in my shoe . once we drive a half hour out of florida on a relaxing sunday afternoon , i realize i have leave my $ 300 michael kor watch in the nightstand drawer next to the bible . i anxiously call the front desk , ask if they could please save my watch so that it could be mail to me . the man i talk to at the desk say `` hi , sir ? yes ! we find your watch ! let me transfer you over to our housekeeping now . . . `` then the call be hang up . day 2 : i call back about my watch . no answer . i leave a voicemail . no call back . day 3 : i e- mail the lost and find - no reply . day 4 : i call the front desk once again . transfer to housekeeping/ lose and find . finally reach a lady . she sound tired and can not speak english . i tell her my info and she say she ' s about to check and call me right back . hang up . no call back . day 5 : send an e- mail . give a call . no response .

"review for the spa and hotel pool only ! book a girl day at the spa ! we be literally look forward to this day 2 week in advance . it be our holiday gift to one another . we book massage and pedis and get a cabana by the pool . it be suppose to be glorious and relax . however , due to some issue , it be just lovely , nothing above and beyond anything else i have ever experience so i be a little let down . spa : it ' s a lovely spa . everything be relax , the mango- ginger signature water be to die for and they have complimentary tea and nut . the lady give our pedicure be fabulous , so friendly and informative , they make u feel extra comfortable . the masseuse be lovely but the massage be just okay . i go for the seasonal orange cream pumpkin pie pedi : relax into a warming whole milk soften soak before experience a richly scent brown sugar scrub for the leg and foot in preparation for a nourishing spiced pumpkin puree mask . leg and foot be then wrap in steamed towel to help sooth away holiday stress . leg and foot be then massage with a silky soft honey suckle orange cream . do it smell good ? absolutely . be there ton of relaxation ? not really . i be expect a little more than just the small , maybe more massaging or detail to relaxation but it be just a regular pedi that smell really good in whiff . valet be include in the spa a well a full access to the private outdoor spa pool area and gym . the spa be lovely and the steam room and hot tub be nice . i wasn ' t a fan of the hot tub be right in front of the shower , just didn ' t make for a full private and relaxing area . everything be super clean ! pool / cabana : the cabana special they be run be for $ 125 for up to 4 people include : all day use ( 10am to 6pm ) , private seating , flat screen television , refrigerator contain chilled water and assorted soda , chip and pretzel , pool towel , outside of your cabana there be 4 lounge chair reserve for you to enjoy . the pool be so empty we could have just take over a small area to ourselves without the cabana but we already pre book it . it say their would be aroma therapy towel , there be not . they mention on the phone when booking that the best area for sun be on the opposite side of the bar ( where two other cabana be ) so we go with that . there be 4 cabana on our side but we be the only occupy one . the downfall . . . it be right next to the kiddie sprinkler . be you kid me ? thanks for the head up = ( that heavens it wasn ' t too busy to the point of constant little kid scream , i be very disappointed we do not get that head up though . and who put private cabana in front of the kid area ? our server be awesome , prop for that ! food be good and come quickly . i do like have our own fridge too , help with drink access . service : while we be lay out , we be approach with our bill from the spa and the girl arrive with all of the wrong information on our bill , not reflect our correct service or deal we book online via fl special . she apologize and leave to get it fixed , she come back and it be still wrong . we give her one card for the cabana and once adjust , other card for our spa service . she run the wrong card for our service . . . sigh . . . we be so frustrate at this point we just allow it and figure the difference in cash and pay each other . for a top notch place like the peabody , i think for sure the service would blow me away . . . it really put a damper on thing . also , one of the lady i be with have her boyfriend call ahead of time to take care of her bill and along that process , they mess up her massage appointment time , originally schedule for the morning , they cancel it and could only fit her in later in the afternoon . i don ' t understand how they mess that up . everything be correct in the note in the system , and it be suppose to be a surprise and they almost give it away to her over the phone = ( overall the location be gorgeous and you really do forget you be in a tourist area , a fabulous get away for the day . i really hope the next time i attend something here , the service be a impeccable a the ambiance .",1,888
"i be give this a 1 star for the simple reason that people go to resort for a vacation . . . to get away from the real world and relax , not to be hassle about buy anything ? ! ? aside from the annoy employee , the resort be great ! i have not have the pleasure of visit florida yet but be not sure i really want to if they pester you that much ? ! ? here be the deal . . . and what people need to be aware of with these timeshares : if you have a mediocre salary and be able to do at least one nice vacation with your family a year . . . then these timeshares be not for you ! ! ! but - you do not have to be a member to visit them and your pricing be not adjust because you be not a member , it be base on demand and time of year . . . just like any other hotel ! so my question be , and i ask this to multiple people , why do i need to buy into your timeshare scam ( i do not say scam to them ) when i can book this a a regular joe- shmoe on the internet ? of course they try to give you all of these benefit . . . but the bottom line be $ $ $ $ . ok , so here it be . . if you be able to afford your current rent and/ or mortgage payment and make another payment of roughly $ 1 , 000 a month ( 300 , 000 point @ $ 0 . 21/ pt . = $ 63 , 000 ) . . . then do this deal ! you would get 300 , 000 point to be use at any one of their resort across the country ( right now there be only a handful of resort but more be expect ) . at the end of your mortgage term you would only be pay maintenance fee . . . which would probably be around $ 900 assume a few increase would happen over your mortgage term . now . . . you would want to get your own loan to pay for that one you just get because there interest rate be 15 . 5 % + ! ! ! that almost double what you would be pay if you go the full term ! ! ! ( in our case it be just over double ? ! ? ) but for around $ 1 , 000 you could book a single 7 night stay at a luxurious resort , or break up the point and do multiple vacation on non- peak week . . . all you pay be a registration fee ( $ 59 currently for each reservation make ) here be our dilemma . . . and what turn u away from it after crunch all the number . we would be pay almost $ 2 , 800 each year to use this `` product '' for the next 10 year . . . assume we didn ' t ' re- mortgage ' it , which would be just plain stupid ! now say it be all pay off a of today , then we would only be pay a yearly club due fee , the maintenance fee plus a registration fee for book a vacation . . . since the package we be look at be ' what we could afford ' , we would have to skip a vacation one year to save the point and put them towards the next year - that alone suck ! so we do that . . . double our point and schedule a vacation for a peak week in the end of august and the grand total for that vacation be ( we would also need to purchase 8 , 000 point from them ! ! ! ) - - - - - $ 2 , 047 . 42 ( assume maintenance fee do not change nor do the club dues increase in the second year ) . now . . . for the comparison . schedule the same exact room at the same exact resort a a non- member - - - - $ 1 , 864 . 80 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! that ' s $ 182 . 62 cheaper for the same exact vacation and guess what . . . that ' s just over $ 900 le than we would be pay for the dang mortgage for those point for one year ? ! ? ! so no . . . this be not a good deal unless you really do have a spare $ 50 , 000 or more lay around that you can drop on a vacation package . sure . . . at the higher point level you be treat better and give more discount , but i guarantee they be bank on people like u that have to scrape the bottom of the bank account after each pay period to make end meet .",0,885
"i love it here . i think part of the reason why my rating be higher than others be that i be lucky enough to get place in tower 1 , which be very recently renovatedour room : we request a handicapped room because i use a scooter here so our bathroom be huge . the room itself be probably the same size a other room . the new decor be modern and nice . the bed be a lot more comfortable than i expect . bonus- tower 1 room actually come with fridge . when i call , i be tell i would need to rent a fridge for $ 15 a night if i want one- that piss me off because this hotel be expensive and a 4 star resort . note , if you be stay in another tower and want to get around the $ 15 a night you can either pack a flat pack cooler bag and fill it with ice and stuff you want refrigerate , buy a styrofoam cooler when you go grocery shopping , or have the mini fridge empty for a $ 25 one time fee and use that . a others say , the wall be super super thin . if you decide to sleep in expect to hear ton of noise between 7- 9am a family get ready to go to the park . other than that i didn ' t really notice the noise . bring earplug and this will be a non- issue . property : i love that the hotel be so close to the park . you can take a boat or walk the path . we walk the path instead of take the boat because we didn ' t want to wait . i think this be a major perk of stay here in addition to the fast pas and early entry . i think the decor be really nice , le cheesy than i expect . i love the courtyard seat area right outside the check in area ( floor 3 ) pool : the pool be pretty amazing and just have a really lay back feel . the pool staff lend out beach ball and pool noodle so you can play or just float . the only downside to this be that if you come during a busy time ( late afternoon on ) you be probably go to get hit by a beach ball at least twice . i really love the amenity of the rp pool compare to the cabana bay pool , they have ice water dispenser everywhere , a staffed towel station , pool activity , and free sunblock . plus cb charge you for beach ball and float etc . so that be lame . if you just want to lay out in the sun or shade there be plenty of place to do that , either by the pool or outside by the water on a man make beach ( no swimming there ) the hot tub be nice but i prefer the one in the fitness center . it seem like most people aren ' t aware that the fitness center locker room have a steam room , sauna , and beautiful indoor hot tub with a relaxation area . whenever the outdoor hot tub be too crowded or i just want some quiet i go in there . restaurant : it be nice that they have restaurant on property , but we only go 3x . we find that we prefer eat breakfast in our room and have other meal at the park or at city walk . the food be a lot better . emeril ' s restaurant be the best out of the three we go to , but we prefer the city walk emeril ' s. bulu bar be pretty lame but convenient and island dining room be epically slow even when it wasn ' t crowd . concierge : we be not entitle `` give me service now '' kind of people but the concierge team be so helpful we find ourselves use them more than we expect . i think this be a huge perk of stay at this hotel compare to the lower tier one . they be incredibly knowledgeable and super nice . tip : try ask to stay in tower 1 when you book or confirm . if you aren ' t in tower 1 and want to save on a fridge pay the $ 25 fee to have the mini fridge empty instead of $ 15/ night fridge rental fee . if your travel date be flexible , play around with the book calendar to see when price be lower . follow some travel blog and google coupon code for your booking site . we get an extra 15 % off our book on top of the stay more save more universal promotion from a blogger . everything cost more in the park . if you can , use an outside grocery vendor ( like garden grocer ) to buy the basic or stop at a store . most cab service charge a small fee to stop at a grocery store for 30 minute after the airport .",1,883
"ok , so last summer i visit my friend from georgia at this resort and i think it be beautiful . so we plan our 2014 summer vacation together here . well this past week be our family vacation . for my family it be our very first disney vacation . my friend make the trip annually . so not know any better i book my trip through the web site not know that this resort be not own or run by disney . so let me try to focus on my stay here . . . . . we pull up to unload luggage and they be very busy , it be around noon . the bellhop be very attentive and a polite young man ! i go in to check in while my husband park the car , $ 16 a day to self park & amp ; $ 20 to valet . i have no issue check in and the staff be pleasant , check in wasn ' t until 3pm yet my room be ready when i get there so they allow u to go up . now i will tell you that a different bellhop saw u to our room and he be hang around for a tip and i guess the first amount give wasn ' t big enough so he hang around a little longer for my husband to pass him more money , mind you we do load and unload most of our thing . now , i be suppose to have a rollaway bed which be not in the room so i call guest service and stop by concierge on the way out to the park and when we return at midnight the bed still be not in the room . i take my certificate down to the front desk and it be in the room before i return from the desk however i still expect it to be there before earlier . ok so i would say around 3- 4pm i head down to guest service to pick up my ticket and they have no idea where i be to pick them up . eventually i be send to the concierge desk where they try to send me back to guest service but my ticket be with them all along . i love that you can walk right down stair and you have access via bus or ferry , they run every 20 minute . the bus take you to all 4 park and the ferry take you to epcot and hollywood studio . the bed be very comfortable and i sleep very well . i ' m sure it have much to do with u walk around the park for 5- 6 hour . in the afternoon we spend much time down at the pool and they do some fun activity with the kid and they have the chance to win free swan ride and stuff . now i do order room service and they be extremely polite and fast and if i wasn ' t so tired i should have go down stair to the picabu ' s restaurant a the price i pay for a pizza i could have get a family meal there . they ask that you don ' t put the tray outside and that you call them right away yet it take almost an hour maybe and hour and a half for them to come get the tray . i also ask for housekeep and they didn ' t come until after 3- 4 pm . not really upset just expect more from what be list a a 5 star resort . i may possibly return here again . . . i have see this resort list on groupon for $ 149 a night plus fee and tax and when i call in advance it be $ 179 a night plus $ 23 a day resort fee plus parking and 12 % tax . i know one thing for certain . . . . . . . a a florida resident i will never ever come here again during the summer for several reason . 1 ) it be too damn hotttttt . . . it be 106 on sunday2 ) there be tooooo damn many people and 3 ) there be not any florida resident discount or benefit . the only reason i would consider not return here be because we be a family of 5 and have a suite at one of their le expensive resort sound much more appealing . i would also rather bring my own snack and drink where there be a small fridge i would have also like to have access to a microwave . i will also advise that there be nothing complimentary . . . . . everything you see cost extra . i think i be plan ahead by purchase disney gift card and they do not accept them at all ! bummer ! ! ! i have about $ 300 in gift card for food and snack and couldn ' t use them here .",1,862

( like 10 min in and 15 min out ) something really uncomfortable to note be that the men ' s spa be only staff by female attendant who pop in and out without much warning . really weird since the entire area be clothe optional . though this do not concern u much , we felt it a bit disconcert that the woman might be expose to you naked if you ' re not cover up at that very moment . they be however quite nice and attentive . now for the bad . . . . really bad . . . . after about 40 min we be steam along with about 3 other guy , all chat about our vacation etc . when we hear the door pull open by 2 male security guard , who state aloud that they be just do a wellness check and then they move on . about 25 min later we be all still converse when the door get pulled wide open by those same 2 security guard , who proceed to say `` we need you all out of here now because we ' re go to be service the spa now '' . i mean really , you ' re go to kick 5 guest out of the steamroom and spa at 7pm when you close at 8 ? the one guard do the annoy yapping be a 20 something attitudinal jerk . he basically send everyone on their way out of the spa , and the funny thing be that there be no servicing of the spa that be go to happen . this be a lie to run off the customer because of his very apparent phobia of men sit and chat with one a other in the steamroom . he proceed to ask u how long we ' ve be in there , and didn ' t we know that it ' s unhealthy to be in there longet than 10 minute , and also state that the reason they be check in on all of u be because they didn ' t have any male spa attendant , blah . . . . blah . . . . blah . . . . basically ruin any form of relaxation we be have . he really anger one guy that have just come from a pay massage session . bottom line be that he be act like the gestapo , and maybe think that in his pea brain there may have be something go on in there . funny thing be that when he rip the door open we be all just sit there in our bathing suit and towel enjoy peaceful conversation . if you ' re ever here and you see a shory , jersey 20 something security guard please splash some water on the floor in hope that he slip and fall on his head to perhaps knock some sense into him . so in final , i do bring this to the attention of the hotel manager chris and he be very sorry and unhappy about hear all of this . he do offer an amicable resolution for our dismay which be very kind ( and very warranted under these circumstance ) . i do hope that this hotel will take this matter very seriously and perform the following correction to the spa management . 1 ) fire the young 20 something caucasian security guard that act like the gestapo to pay guest . totally rude , unprofessional and not a hilton team member i can assure you . 2 ) hire only male spa attendant for the male spa . 3 ) leave your guest alone to be in peace and quiet when in the spa and steamroom area . they do not want to be bother by gestapo guard yank the steamroom door open inquiring a to why and how long they have be in there , and further dictate that any more than 10 min be not good for you . we predominantly stay at hiltons around the globe and this be the first time i have ever hammer them in an online review . needle to say i will never stay at this particular resort again ! this review be also be send to hilton corporate a well .",0,828
"i have no doubt that wonderful and magical time can be have here with photo and memory to match . even have one senior citizen friend who have be here with his family ( two daughter ) when they be small year ago and continue to come here annually now that they be adult ! our time here be `` meh '' - we have spend two full day drive to arrive - with a toddler , so it be more our situation that prevent our enjoyment of the venue a one in our party of four become ill and require a wheelchair . this review will , i fervently hope , be read by the disney people a well a anyone travel with a disabled person to animal kingdom or the magic kingdom , the only place we visit `` inside the park '' . by the time we actually reach animal kingdom , a 10- 15 minute drive from our disney resort , and park in the handicapped lot , we walk the lot and reach a station where you could thankfully pick up a courtesy wheelchair , which we do . more walking bring u to the main entrance where we pass through two security check , and be approach by smily personnel who inform u it would be necessary for u to go `` over there '' and rent a chair to be use inside the park , a we be use one assign to the parking lot . ok - pay to rent a different chair and resettle our passenger and be on our way to have brunch or lunch perhaps 500 foot away at the rainforest cafe . at the entrance we be approach smilingly and tell that we could not bring the rented wheelchair into the restaurant because the restaurant be technically not a part of the park so we would have to park it `` over there '' with our stroller and they would provide u with one of their courtesy wheelchair for use while we be in the restaurant . we once again transferred chair . third chair within 15 minute - insanity ! why not provide the handicapped with pogo stick ? we have an enjoyable lunch , come out and again have to transfer our person from the restaurant wheelchair to the rent wheelchair . sadly , yet not surprisingly , our person be so fatigue from jump in and out of chair that we decide it wisest to return to our lodging to enable rest . and yes , we then have to turn in the chair we have rent and transfer again to the courtesy chair to use from the park into the parking lot . to recap then , a handicapped person need to get in the car , get out of the car , get to the wheelchair and sit , get out of the wheelchair to sit in a different one , get push 500 foot and get out of the chair to sit in a different chair to go 50 foot to eat , leave the restaurant and get out of the chair to get into the rented chair to go 500 foot to return the chair and transfer to another chair to get wheel to get into the car to leave . fun ? uh , no . want to hear about day 2 - magic kingdom day ? similar start with a 10- 15 min drive from our resort , we arrive fed not wish a repeat of the prior day ' s fiasco , park in handicapped lot , be able to slowly walk to a tram that drive u to the entrance where we be able to , little by little , make our way up the ramp thankfully with railing , to board the monorail which bring u inside the park where we rent another wheelchair . we enjoy make our way up main street to the castle , stop in a couple shop , enjoy lunch al fresco , listen to the band , but once again fatigue necessitate our departure so no character , ride , etc . should you be travel into wdw park , i can not recommend strongly enough for your sanity , wallet , and convenience and even moreso for the comfort of anyone you love in need of wheelchair assistance that you bring your own and avoid the nightmare we experience . disney ? please find a better system . visit your park be not cheap and be suppose to be fun . i highly doubt what we experience to be the only occurrence or time you have hear this or a similar complaint . you make it more difficult and get a thumb down for that . perhaps we will give this place another go sometime in the future - perhaps .",0,822
"i just return from a 4- night stay at the all- star movie resort last week . know it ' s one of disney ' s `` value '' resort , i go in with expectation set accordingly . it be myself and my partner ( no kid ) , and it be just fine for u . maybe because we go during the `` off- season '' or because it ' s disney world ( so we expect there to be a lot of kid ) , but we weren ' t bother by other family or child at the resort . here be my pro and con : pros- we stay at the very back of the hotel , in the mighty duck section . grant , this be the furthest possible walk to the lobby/ cafeteria/ transportation but it be also much quieter and seclude than stay closer or around the pool . which , a you can imagine , be very nice after long day at the park . and honestly ? the walk isn ' t that lengthy . an extra 2 or 3 minute , top . if you can walk around disney park all day , then this shouldn ' t be an issue . - disney transportation include in room price . we didn ' t have to deal with the added expense of rent a car , because there be constant bus to and from all the disney park . sign be clearly mark outside the hotel let you know where each bus be go . whether we be head to the park or leave the park and return to the hotel , we never wait more than 20 minute for a bus . and the only time we do wait an actual 20 minute be leave the magic kingdom with the other 6 billion people after the firework show , so to be honest- i think we ' d be wait longer . - airport transportation include in room price . again , totally save a ton on not have to rent a car . disney ' s magical express be include with the room . they pick u up from the airport after arrive and drop u back off at the airport when departing . - room be decently size , have everything you need if you ' re planning to use it mainly for sleep and shower ( and spend the rest of your time at the park ) . might be kind of cramped for a family with multiple child , but it be just fine for my partner and i. also , room have free wi- fi . cons- my only grievance with disney ' s magical express be that it be about 15 minute late picking u up after our stay and then we have to stop at 3 other nearby resort before head to the airport . didn ' t seem to be a whole lot of urgency there , which be odd because . . . it wasn ' t like we have a plane to catch or anything ! - lobby always seem to be a little disorganized and busy , no matter what time of day it be . the girl at the front desk never activate my magic band to unlock the hotel room door ( it work everywhere else though ) . not a big deal , because my partner ' s be activate and open the room door just fine - and i be with her the entire time - but could ' ve be an inconvenience otherwise . - cafeteria be kind of pricy and the employee there be always a bit cranky . grant , everywhere in disney be `` kind of pricy '' but the food there certainly isn ' t worth what they ' re charge for it . however , it ' s convenient to have a place within the hotel to stop for coffee , a muffin , a snack , etc on your way in or out of the hotel and they have a pretty diverse selection of item . all in all , it be a decently price budget hotel that offer the benefit of stay on a disney property . no frill or super luxurious accommodation , but you also save a lot of money on transportation and with the low room price . if you ' re planning to spend a lot of time at the resort , this may not be the best option - but if you ' re planning to spend the majority of your time at the disney park , then this be a great option . you get what you pay for , so just be sure to set your expectation beforehand and spend your time enjoy the park ! ~",1,818
"we check in on friday night at about 8 : 30 pm . we have stay at these resort before and truly enjoy our time . this visit be not a enjoyable ! our first night check in we wait forever ! long line and little help ! once we be greet we meet nicole . she seem to be a un- sincere a a person can be and very fake . she seem to be program to push through her scripted introduction and if you need anything more you be out of luck . i specifically ask if there be any other cost involve in our stay and since we be charge 150 . 00 deposit for incidental i ask what possible incidental could there be , she state none and it just a policy to withhold a deposit . my wife be very tire so she remain in the vehicle while i check u in . when i give nicole our credit card she state since it say my wife ' s name and our business name i would have to go get my wife to sign the paper . i show her it be a business card and say i be the owner of the business but she refuse to allow me to sign . after go out to get my wife we be present the rule of stay and again i ask if there be any other possible charge we will have , nicole assure u there be none . once we leave the check in , we go to our room , once we arrive we couldnt get the key to work in the electric key entry system . we have to go back and have the key re- programed . once we have the new key we go back to the room and still have trouble get into the room . about 20 minute later we finally get the key to work . once we unpack and settle in we be get ready to lay down and thats when i think i would pull out my laptop and check my email . i couldnt log on so i call the front desk and nicole say , well you have to pay for internet access it 26 . 00 for the week ! i say well hey , dont you remember tell me 3 time there be no other charge ! she have no sympathy , she want the money ! i say , ok just add the 26 . 00 to our credit card you have on file . she say no , you have to bring your wife back down and sign up at the desk for the code to log on ! now remember we just wait forever to even get the key and check in now we have to go back to the desk which by the way be about a 1/ 4 mile from our room . we go down and pay the fee and head back to the room , and yes , it take another 15 minute to get back into the room ! we be wear out by this time so decide to go to bed . we be in bed for about 30 minute when we hear a noise by the door , next thing we know people be walk into our room ! apparently the hotel desk give these people the same room a u ! we call the front desk , nicole offer little apology other than say if we want a 20 . 00 coupon for the bar we could come back to the desk and get it ! i tell nicole no thank you we dont drink alcohol . she then say she would send security up to our room with a gatorade . the next day we leave to go eat dinner . when we return we try to enter our room again and the electrical key reader be completely dead . we call the front desk and 15 minute later they send a security guard to come look at it . when he arrive he be fumble around with the door and every word out of his mouth be a cuss word . then he say well i have to go back to the office and get another tool ill be back . . . so we wait another 15 minute for him to go get his tool . finally we be able to gain access to our room while barney fife take our door apart try to see what the problem be . after all this we do have a very nice room and be able to rest which be the purpose for our trip . the room be very nice the hallway be not , they could be compare to a motel 6 hallway .",0,817

"i book six night at the wyndham bonnet creek resort through a third party website for a trip to orlando to celebrate my boyfriend ' s 30th birthday . base off of the picture offer on the website , i be super excite about our stay . i call the resort to make a special request for a room in tower 6 , a it be popular among yelp reviewer . i also attempt to request this through the third party website . i be tell i could only request a specific tower upon arrival . no big deal . when we finally arrive at the resort , we be tell there be no room available in tower six . we be assign to tower three . i ask if any room be to open up in tower six , could we please switch at any point in our stay . we be tell it would cost $ 98 to switch room due to the fact that this be a time share and we have to pay a cleaning fee . the website i have use to book our room say nothing about it be a time share . we be then send to another desk to get a parking pas , where they offer u a $ 150 gift card to attend the free breakfast and learn more about the time share opportunity . we decline politely . the woman at the desk then ask u , `` why ? you have a lot of money ? `` yikes . i may not be wealthy , but i do put a lot of money into the trip include the stay at this hotel , thank you very much . i be already feel bum about the lack of availability in tower six and just want to go unpack and rest up . we head up to our room a soon a it be ready . the room be pretty nice . some stain on the furniture , and it have a weird smell , but nothing horrible . i decide to open the balcony door to let the room air out and get rid of the smell . i be meet with a loud noise come from the row of generator locate eight floor below in the parking lot . i lay down for a few minute and listen to the hum of the generator . i decide it be go to be difficult to sleep and i would try again to ask nicely if a room be to open up in tower six , could we please switch ? i call downstairs and speak to a manager who explain to me that time share owner get top priority and everyone want to stay in tower six a it be the newest tower . she tell me there be no room available , but if any open up i could pay $ 99 . 98 to switch . i don ' t know why the cost go up $ 1 . 98 from the first quote . she also tell me it concern her that i could hear the generator all the way from the top floor a no one have ever complain about that before . what the plum ? i wish i could post an audio clip to this revue . maybe i have extra sensitive hearing , i don ' t know , but i could hear them loud and clear . and i be base my experience off of what i be hear , not what past guest have complain about . in the end , we be here for six more night , and the only word i can use to describe the experience so far be disappointing . if i have know pay $ 800 to stay at a hotel would result in our stay be le important than the time share owner , i never would have book this pariticular `` resort '' . i want to love this place , and think i would , but i guess my expectation be too high ? i be hop they would have great customer service and could accomodate u by wave the $ 98 fee , but wind up just feel like i be an annoyance rather than a value customer . i have have better customer service at a best western . i win ' t stay here again . i be give two star because with the lazy river and close proximity to park , this may be a good place for a family to stay . just bring your ear plug or an extra hundred dollar ! cheer to anyone who be lucky enough to score tower six ! : )",0,801
"this be the shittest one i ' ve ever stay . i go there to stay only one night since my brother ' s flight be 6 in the morning and neither of u want to drive too early from gainesville . by the way , i just get back from there today . the first thing you will face be the front desk will charge you $ 5 . 09 per night because whatever travel website you ' ve make a reservation , they didn ' t get `` the service fee '' from your credit card . yup , they can take cash at the front desk if you want . fine . we go to the assigned room . i look okay before we realize there ' s no bath towel . seriously , who will expect to find no bath towel when you walk into 3 star hotel ? call the housekeeping , and what they tell me be `` we be out of bath towel . i can give you hand towel instead . however , you need to come down to the front desk to pick these towel since i be the only one staying in the housekeeping center right now. `` oh , how kindly be that ? it be after midnight . we know it be late . but we didn ' t know it be that late to get a bath towel . we give up the bath towel since my brother need to go to the airport by 6 in the morning and we be really tire and sleepy . my bro take a shower and try to dry himself with small hand towel . after shower , he be more annoyed by one more thing . he say , `` it seem like the toilet be leak . i don ' t know that ' s from the toilet or the bathtub , but something ' s leaking. `` yeah , this be 3 star hotel , right ? in the early morning , i drop my bro off and come back to hotel to take little more rest . before get back to the room , i ask the front desk guy that something ' s leaking in the bathroom . he look up some list , and tell me that they know and try to fix it asap . okay , this mean they know something go wrong with this room but didn ' t care their guest will like the fact or not . or , they think their guest wouldn ' t notice the leaking . oh , really ? i be mad , but tire . when i get back to the room , i realize the curtain would cover the whole window . only the white translucent curtain be cover the window , not the thick one . the dark- colored curtain , i look at their hook , be block to pull across the window which expose everything in the room to the hallway . i have to sleep in the sunshine a time pass . i wish i could post the picture i take so i can make very clear i be not lie . oh , one more thing . when i call up the housekeeping lady , i ask her to give me a toothpaste and a toothbrush after find their little note say '' forget something ? we have a variety of item available free of charge to help you avoid those last minute emergencies. `` below they list 7 item include toothpaste and toothbrush . she tell me i can get a toothbrush but toothpaste be all out of order . so . . again , this mean i can brush teeth without toothpaste ? when i ask her this stupid question , she advise me to go get a toothpaste from a gas station . how helpful be she ! okay , it be cheap price . however , that price be make you deserve what i have from this experience . some of you say there wasn ' t a bug ? we find a bug right after we get in ! i just can ' t believe i pay even a little money on this shitty hotel . even a one star motel provide you a bath towel ! oh , they actually wake me up and give me a bath towel at 8 : 30 in the morning . a i already write , my bro be already leave at that time and i be sleep and have no idea why they be knock the door and wake me up .",0,788

"we only book here because it be a vacation pkg through virgin america and it appear that of all the hotel we look at ( that be not disney hotel ) , they have the greatest amount of shuttle to the themeparks at different time . most other hotel only have 1 or two shuttle per day . . . so , that ' s why we pick this place . 1. yes indeed they have multiple shuttle per day and at different time . however they be always late ! most time they be up to 20 minute late . 2. the concierge ( or so i though he be ) assist the first night after our arrival by tell u where to go to eat at downtown disney . we miss the last shuttle leave the hotel for the night so would have to take a cab there but could catch the last shuttle back to the hotel . get there ok. . . . problem be the concierge tell u the wrong location to catch the return shuttle so we miss it and have to take a cab back to the hotel . that be an extra 15 dollar for a 2 mile ride ! it wasn ' t a small error either . he draw u a map where the shuttle would be but it be actually on the opposite side of downtown disney from where he tell u . 3. they have meter cab and non- metered cab . trust me , it ' s cheaper to take the metered cab . each time we have to take the non- meter it be always most expensive ( after add the tip ) than the metered cab be . 4. this be suppose to be a convention hotel but the wifi suck ! nor be it free . $ 9 . 95 a day but at least they give you up to 4 device with it . we have 2 cell phone and 1 ipad . each of them would only get max 2 band on the wifi . 5. free parking which be good . 6. go to check in for my flight and use their business center and printer to print out my boarding pass . believe it or not , they only have 1 computer to use and it didn ' t even have a mouse . have to stand to use it because they didn ' t have a chair . and this be a convention hotel ? ? 7. go to make an appt for a massage at the day spa . book out over a week . . . . 2 day past when we be leave ! 8. go to rent a car at the hertz on site . no car available to rent . no help to even call another location . be just tell sorry , cant help you . so , have to take a cab to another hotel to rent a car . 9. there be a cv across the street which we though be great because we need a few thing . but , it ' s a major street on front of the hotel and no crosswalk ! you have to run across the street to go the cv which be dangerous . 10. the hotel picture on their website be obviously airbrush . because when you see the hotel in person , it ' s very dated and old . seem very dirty too . wall be all scuff up . tile be dirty . just be kind of icky to look at . 11. coffee place on site . . . but very limited item available . 12. there be a 24 hour cafe which be nice . 13. no online or tv checkout available . 14. i don ' t know if all room be like this . . . but , we have about a 1 . 5 inch gap under the room door which be disturb for some reason . 15. bed be comfortable . 16. i mention that i think the concierge be a concierge because that ' s the desk he be at . however , after draw u the map he start in with their timeshare sale pitch . i do not expect this . . . . and be one of the reason why i do not want to stay at a disney hotel . overall , crappy hotel . there be many 1 or 2 star hotel that describe the same thing that i describe here . read them !",0,777
"wow honestly i be blow away by this hotel . . . . word can not express how much i enjoy stay here for nearly a week . the room be absolutely gorgeous , the bed the most comfortable thing i have ever sleep on in my entire life , the balcony have an amazing view , the bathroom spectacular with a rain shower that be so relaxing . i love the food there a well they have a breakfast buffet which we hit up more time than not , they have a station where a cook make fresh for you the most amazing belgium waffle i ' ve ever have and one of the beat selection ever from typical thing like scramble egg and bacon to an amazing cheese and meat display . the waitstaff at the buffet be the most friendly and warm people . . . no matter how busy the always be around when need . but unfortunately the same cant be say for the other guest who act like they have never saw food before , this be definitely a wait your turn move down the line very classy style of buffet , yet i really felt like slap some of these people and teach them some manner . i have a man literally nearly knock me over and smash my plate against my shirt ( not cool ) because he want to get to the scramlbed egg before me . i have another man snatch up the fork thing for the ham right a my hand be inch above it , not to mention on one busy day there be ton of people wait all infront of the desk area since my sister be in a wheel chair and my daughter in her stroller we be sit in the table on the main level not the drop down area so we have to walk past the desk to get to the buffet . so since my fiancé and father eat in 3 second to go have ciggys outside my mom and i be leave with my sister and my baby , i have to go up twice once for me once for my mom . so with a million other place to stand this brawd stand right im the only walkway and even though she can clearly see she ' s in the way and i ' ve have to say excuse me 3 time now ( up , back , up , ) on my way back i say excuse me she have the nerve to roll her eye and ughhh . really ? seriously ? i want to dump my egg on her head for real . but anywho i didn ' t because they be delicious and i know it so i just say `` your in the way of everyone '' and with a shocked face she say sorry and look like she realize she almost get feed to the alligator that live outside : ) ok so also i a night owl so i order room service a couple time and omg my new favorite sandwich ever by far be this turkey sandwich with a fried egg on it not something i would typically eat but i try it plan on take off the egg and be pleasantly surprise to find out it be soooooo freak good i eat it almost once a day . ( btw there be this amazing sauce that i get one of the night from room service it wasn ' t the wasabi ranch cause i try it the next night but it be something green and amaze anyone know what it be ? ) so my parent practically call this place their second home they bring my little sister and just lay by the pool and relax so they always sit in a certain waitress ' section ( i think her name be vonda super tan super cool ) they constantly talk about the amazing piña coladas so of course i try one and wow whatever rum it be i ask and forget be honestly the best drink i have ever ever ever have and boy be she quick when we need refill ! not ro mention almost half the staff know my dad name everywhere we go i hear someone say oh hi mr. malloy ! awesome . the room be soooo nice and modern just like the rest of this hotel that have a parrot name merlot that love my pink hair : ) i will without a doubt return many time ! ! ! !",1,775
"i post this review on the orange lake site but they choose not to post it : it greatly sadden me to write this review . i check in to orange lake on friday , april 25th for my daughter ' s birthday . we have be plan a long weekend celebration for her for month . because of work schedule , our entire party arrive in 3 separate vehicle at different time . when i get to the security gate on friday i ask if i need to provide the name of the additional guest for them to gain entry . i be tell that they only need my room number and my name at the gate . i have be to the resort a a guest last summer and this be the only information i provide so it make sense . when i check in , i again ask the young lady at the check- in counter the protocol for my additional guest to gain entry . she confirm what the security guard have just say - - room number and the name the reservation be under . i provide the information to the remain guest and when the first car arrive they didn ' t even ask them for a room number let alone my name . they be permit to drive right in . when the second , and last guest arrive , he provide the required information and be deny entry . he even produce the text message i send him with all of the information on it . he be tell to pull off to the side of the road and that he could not enter because his name wasn ' t on a list . they tell him i have to go up to my room ( i be no where near my room at the time ) and call from there to confirm that he be permit to enter the resort . my previous guest weren ' t even ask for a room number . here be the kicker . . . . the guest that be provide full access without need to provide a room number be white . the guest that be humiliate and embarrass and not allow to enter be black . my daughter be in tear because her family member be deny entry . she be 8 year old and she know the reason immediately . when i report the incident to customer care , i be meet with extreme sympathy from the 2 lady i speak with . one of them be actually in tear with me . i be direct to go report the incident to the head of security and he be le sympathetic . although i could tell he wasn ' t thrill by what happen , he be more concerned with get the people who tell me that i didn ' t need to leave the additional guest ' s name at the security station in trouble . when i tell him 2 separate employee with orange lake tell me the same thing , his response be `` the people at check- in don ' t know the procedure '' . huh ? i speak with several owner and they all state that they have never have to provide the guest ' s name and that the guest provide their room number and name be the protocol they always understand to be true and be follow . they have never have a guest reject . they all state , however , all of their guest ' s have be white . when we be check out today every person in line ahead of u be complain to a staff member about a bad experience . when i tell him mine his response be `` well , we don ' t know exactly what happen in that car. `` i guess i should have tell my professional , 50 year old black family member who be excite to spend the day and celebrate with his daughter to make sure he hide his skittle and iced tea so the security guard win ' t suspect him of harm . this be one of those event that will stick with our family and will not be forget . perhaps i should have clarify to security and the front desk that one of my guest be black . i might have get a different answer a to the protocol for gain entry to a resort you have already pay for to spend time with your family .",0,770
"my husband and i stay at this hotel after we complete a seven day cruise and find out our flight home be delay four day due to a blizzard in the north east . we grab a rental car and drove from fort lauderdale to orlando to spend our time at disney . along the way we stop and search online for a hotel close to disney that be a reasonable price . we choose the hyatt due to the close location to disney and that they advertise a constant shuttle run to the park . we arrive to discover that this resort will present a good price online , but they nickel and dime you all over the place ! $ 16 to park your own car , a daily $ 22 resort fee and $ 24 . 58 a day in tax . we quickly dump the rental car due to the cost of the parking and the shuttle offer by the hotel . big mistake . . the shuttle run twice in the morning and three time in the evening . not continuous all day service a advertised . so what become a decent price hotel quickly add up to over $ 230 a night ! we book two night from the road only to find out that night that our flight be delay another day . the hotel tell u they be sell out for our last night and we have to find another place to stay . we keep check online and we be able to get a room the morning before we would have to check out at a base rate of $ 65 more than the first two night ! best part be that we have to check out at 3 be to catch out flight too ! the water area of the resort be under construction so the main pool be not open which be a bummer for me . the parrot in the lobby be cool and the hotel overall be very nice although i agree with another reviewer a there be no hot water in the shower . my biggest complaint besides the disappointment of the shuttle be on the second morning we be wake up at 6 : 30 be by our next door neighbor who be scream on the phone in russian . i have to call security three time between 6 : 30 and 8 : 30. the security guard saw the gentleman leave his room around 8 : 45 be and knock on our door . i be tell that she could not hear that yell from the hallway , but trust me , it be so loud in our room especially a we have a connecting door . the security guard linda be lovely , apologize and even leave u two bottle of water and a fruit plate upon our return that even . i email the front desk manager from the park that day and then complain at checkout and be offer $ 99 . 99 refund . i absolutely would have take my sleep over the $ 99 ! ! i be just check my credit card statement and the hotel charge an additional amount on our credit card during our stay for around $ 240. i just call the front desk and be tell this be only an authorization , but it appear on my card date 2/ 11/ 13 and be mark a a transaction to me . i be tell to give it a few more day a they have it a an `` authorization '' and it should disappear from our card . seriously . . . 8 day later and that be the answer ? i email the front desk manager about this issue earlier today and have not hear back . overall a nice hotel , but disappoint by noise , lack of shuttle service and overcharging . the hotel be also host 3 or 4 company convention so there be a lot of drink go on in the main bar in the lobby . not sure i would feel comfortable list this hotel a kid friendly . sadly , i will not be recommend or return anytime soon . what turn into be stick in fl for four extra day have become a lot more work and headache than it should be . and turn up the hot water ! very disappointing and frustrating experience for a 4 star hyatt resort .",0,756
"let me preface my review by say that the owc marriott be a beautiful property . it ' s huge , you can see it from far away . our room ( laser pool view ) , although small , have a view of the laser pool and surprisingly have a view of epcot which mean we saw their firework nightly a well . in the distance we could also see the firework at magic kingdom and directly in front of u be the firework at hollywood studio . it be great ! the laser show be a little `` cheesy '' but great for the kid . now the downside . the property be too big . the self parking include in our package be quite a haul . the car out front dropping/ pick up be constantly there . people everywhere ! i have a few thing ship ahead of time . i call to get the shipping address and be tell i just pick up my package at the front desk . upon arrival around 5pm on saturday , i be tell the package be actually in the business center but the business center be close for the day . ok , slightly annoy since i be tell the front desk would have it , but whatever . i be tell the business center open the next day at 7am . great , since it contain life jacket for the kid and we want to swim ! walk ( a long walk ) down to the business center the next day , door lock , sign say `` close for easter '' . the front desk tell me it would open at 7 , no mention of the holiday . so now i don ' t have swim gear for saturday or sunday and monday be our last full day . by the way , the package that u mail to the front desk actually go to their business center own by fedex and the charge me a $ 10 handle fee for each box . maybe this could ' ve be mention when i call the week before to inquire about ship to the hotel . i be tell on the phone that the toddler pool would open at 8am . head down that morning , without our life jacket . the easter bunny be out there , which be great , we get a pic then start swim . after about 10min a female employee tell u we can ' t swim without a lifeguard . after explain i be tell we could swim at 8 she point at a sign on the other side that say the pool open at 10 and that `` this pool never open before 10 '' . she go away to speak to a manager . come back and say we need to go to the big pool and `` they ' ll try '' to have a lifeguard there by 9. gee , thanks for the favor . monday ( no joke ) i get three different answer a to when the toddler pool open . i even have the concierge tell me `` it probably open at 8 , if we get out there and it ' s close , come back in and he ' ll get to the bottom of it '' . ( because that ' s so easy to do at a gigantic property with two small kid . for the record it open at 9 , not 8 like the concierge say and not 10 like the snotty girl say the sign say . apparently we be suppose to read mind and know that on day two we magically need green bracelet and towel card even though on day one , we didn ' t. this hotel , although gorgeous , have a customer service deficit . no personal touch , no feeling welcome , no one willing to get you a straight answer to a simple question . we felt like a number , not a guest . win ' t be return for business or pleasure . upon voice my concern ( without detail ) i receive a generic email from a manager name cheryl say she relay my concern to the various department . obviously not true , because i hadn ' t tell her what my specific problem be , only that we encounter several problem during our stay .",0,752
"stay here for a conference at nearby hotel & amp ; for disney . a far a a crash pad , it ' s acceptable . the heated pool be nice , the one work hot tub be clean , the bed be comfy . short- order food in the morning at the deli be good . tiki bar be standard pricing for an orlando spot and the food be ok though nothing to go back for . ashley be a great bartender . but : 1 ) there ' s significant grout issue in the shower ( it look like a child lay the tile ) and what look like either mildew or mold at the base of the bath . maybe just a hard water issue , but it look pretty gross . bathtub be also surprisingly shallow , with a very cheap drain plug and not very hot hot water . 2 ) the power have go out twice in the past 48 hour we ' ve be here . it ' s florida , power outage aren ' t surprising , but i ' d expect a major chain hotel to have a generator . in one instance , the power be off for 15 minute before we decide to give up and just leave early for our conference day . 3 ) this afternoon there have be 90+ minute of continuous rhythmic pounding somewhere in the hotel , apparently mechancial . the front desk be kind and someone call an engineer ; it stop briefly , then start again . try to rest after a day at disney ? not gon na happen . . . . and i really need the sleep ! the front desk didn ' t actually follow up on the issue ; `` engineering '' say it be fix and no one double- check when it resume 20 minute later . oof . 4 ) if your employer be pay for your hotel ( not unusual for a town with professional conference center ) , make sure you bring a company credit card , or get a credit card authorization form . they wouldn ' t let u check in unless we give them a card to charge the room and incidental to , even though we ' d reserve online . since we don ' t carry the employer ' s card , we have to put everything on a personal card and then have the hotel email a form to our employer , who have to fax it back with the info that have already be provide in the online reservation . not very convenient , especially if you don ' t like carry a huge hold on your cc ! i ' m hear mixed review from friend on this a an `` industry standard '' , but i ' ve definitely stay in hotel before where reserve with a cc do not require that same cc to be use on site . 5 ) $ 9 for a buffet breakfast at the restaurant that be , in the two day we stay , either cold and unstocked because the power be off , or so packed we couldn ' t get in . brew coffee be extra . 6 ) one of the hall smell very strongly of urine throughout the hallway . 7 ) terribly insulated door . anything happen in the hall sound like it be happen inside our room . 8 ) advertise hot tub with waterfall be rope off . any of these would be tolerable alone , but a a sum total . . . not a location that be restful at all ! if you just need to be in town and can survive without power in the morning , it ' s a great cheap option - - but you ' re definitely go to get what you pay for . update a of 2/ 1 : our complaint have twice be pass to `` management , `` with no actual result other than `` i ' m so sorry you have this experience. `` i ' m sorry too- - that ' s why i ask for a manager , write a review about how bad it be , and reach out to corporate ! this place be full of people apologize but make no actual attempt to remedy the situation . beyond disappointing . stay somewhere else .",0,751
"i stay here back in 2006 when i come to orlando to prepare for my move here to work at disney ( for which i do for almost 3 year ) . back then it be a crowne plaza , it be new , and it be gorgeous . and the price be insanely wonderful for a hotel like that - - i think it be still $ 69 or $ 79 and the only reason i think it ' s so low for this quality of a hotel be because it ' s not on the part of i- drive that be amongst all those hotel . thing be , though , that ' s a blessing , not a curse , because not only be it quieter down there , prettier , it ' s also closer to disney - - actually , in between disney and seaworld . ( the north end of i- drive where all the hotel be be minute from universal. ) the hotel look wonderful on the outside , like a hotel you ' d find in key west or some other tropical place , with large ground , and the interior hallway be also very nice and feel very upscale . the lobby be nice , although not a impressive a the other part of the hotel and the front desk be just ' ok. ' the room be nicely decorate and the bed have wonderful white bedspread and they be very comfortable , and it make for a pleasant stay . i come back to orlando a few week ago to stay here again for one night and the price be still a very reasonable $ 69 for king and $ 79 for two queen - - still a steal . ala , the folk who work at the front desk be more of the `` motel 6 '' variety than that of , say , a hilton , which will come a a shock to you after have see the hotel ' s exterior and hallway . they ' re not necessarily unpleasant or difficult , but they ' re not neatly dress and don ' t have the same type of courtesy of a nicer hotel . i ' m a bit surprise the owner don ' t `` get '' that . but that be such a small part of your hotel experience that i really wouldn ' t let that bother you , folk . so , ok - - after come back 5- 1/ 2 year later , the hotel still have the great look on the outside , great look in the hallway , same lobby situation , and the room be still nicely decorate . the room , however - - a tad get old . still fine , still comfortable , it ' s just that they need a little freshening up . but , by no mean , be this anywhere close to the aforementioned motel 6 , this be still a nice place , and i guess i can say an amazing place for the price , give the feel of it , give the location . do be forewarn : to unload your luggage you have to park at a part of the hotel that be a bit of a walk down a hall to the front desk ( albeit nicely carpet hall ) - - for some reason they don ' t have a drive up directly to the lobby . furthermore , the parking lot be behind the hotel and that be also a little bit of a walk to the lobby ( although by no mean a football field length like at disney hotel ! ) . there be no valet service . the person who review this below from march 2011 - - although she be mostly kind to this hotel , i think she her expectation be a bit high - - this be not a 4- star or 5- star hotel , but a very good 3- star , and i think you definitely get a bit more than you pay for . it ' s also go to be a place for people who absolutely want to get away from the hubub of the park , and the usual kid run down the hallway , it will be a much quieter experience , i can assure you .",1,745

"we spend 5 night at the buena vista palace a part of a package disney vacation we purchase through amex . buena vista palace be a mixed bag . here be what you need to know : the good : 1. very convenient location . you can ' t get much closer to disney without stay at an actual disney operate resort . it be walk distance from downtown disney and it be on a disney shuttle route operate by mears transportation . 2. economical . relative to other option , particularly disney operate resort , it be economical . i think we save $ 1k over a 4 night stay at a disney resort we have price . 3. reliable transportation to disney . they offer shuttle service approximately every 30 minute to and from the disney theme park until an hour or so after the park close . it isn ' t perfect but we manage to stay here without a rental car for the 5 day we be visit . 4. spacious suite . the suite be very comfortably size and larger than average suite we be use to stay in at other hotel . we stay in a one bed one and half bath suite and be really able to spread out . when you be travel with small child this be a big plus . that say a tire a we be from long day at the park we really do only use the hotel for sleep . 5. free wifi . 6. they offer a kid eat free package . we didn ' t get to eat many meal here a we eat at the theme park most day but the two meal we be serve be free for the kid . the bad : 1. we book a two queen size bed suite . they put u in a one king size bed suite our first night and couldn ' t move u until the next day . to their credit , they do move all our belonging to the correct room the next day while we be at the magic kingdom . 2. the layout . the buena vista palace consist of a primary tower and a detached and separate `` islander building '' . i don ' t know what the tower be like but the islander building be separate from the main tower and all of the hotel service ( except housekeep ) by a bayou , a pool , and lot of landscape . it ' s a long as haul from the front desk to your room . there be no staff assign to the islander building . once you be there you really be on the island . you better have exact change if you want a coke from the coke machine in the building . if you want to go the gym , business office , minimart , arcade , restaurant , bar etc plan on pack some comfortable shoe because you have a long walk ahead of you . 3. shuttle start time . the shuttle start at 8 be . if you want to be at the them park when they open at 8 you aren ' t go to make it on the shuttle service . the service be share among a variety of hotel in the downtown disney area . at time they get quite crowd . be prepare to stand a lot especially on the way back . buena vista palace be the last stop on the route before the shuttle return to disney world . the ugly : 1. outside of the street level floor of the main tower the carpet throughout the lower level of the tower and the islander building be absolutely filthy look . we have two small kid and a dog and we don ' t have near this many stain on our carpet at home . this apply to the common area and the room themselves . they be long overdue for replacement . the wall paper be disrepair a well in the hall of the islander building . one expect more from a resort with respect to decor . the good outweigh the bad at buena vista palace but not by a wide margin . i would stay again if i couldn ' t find a better alternative to try out .",0,738

"stay here for a two week stretch in january . decent hotel , you get what you pay for . i do get a decently clean room . if you be look in this price range , the hotel isn ' t suppose to be perfect . this would be a 1 or 2 star if i pay $ 100+ a night , but for $ 45 it ' s a solid 3 star . there be no cockroach , and hardly any bug that we saw . we didn ' t have random bite and our foot didn ' t turn black after walk around in our own room . we also get to park in front of our room door quite a bit , which be nice after a full day at the park . some thing to note , the maid be not very good . anytime we would move a piece of furniture we would find something leave by a guest before . underneath bed we ' d find wrapper or piece of food . we even find a full package of bounce laundry sheet underneath the bedside stand . we didn ' t get the full maid service everyday . we usually leave the do not disturb sign up but we forget one day on our rush to the park . they go through our stuff and organize for u , and move the stuff off of our bed and into various place in the room so they could make our bed . wish they didn ' t do that . most hotel don ' t touch your personal belonging if they can avoid it , but these people have no problem do it . when you have a two year old , it kind of suck to have him pull wrapper of thing we never eat out from place , but it ' s what i pay for . this place can get loud . we could hear bang quite a bit from above u and outside our room . not a deal breaker but kind of annoy . the bathroom be pretty bad . you literally can ' t open the door without it hit the toilet . annoy at first , but you get use to it . also , there be old mold spot on the shower curtain . not the prettiest thing . the `` hot '' breakfast they offer be pathetic . it ' s one of the worst hotel breakfast i ' ve ever have . it ' s just so small , and there be no where to sit down ( there be 1 table inside and 1 outside , which be usually full. ) it ' s limit to two kind of cereal , i get the fruit loop , bagel and danish . there be some frozen waffle that be sit out in a container for you to heat up , coffee , juice and milk . it ' s only `` hot '' if you use the toaster . the location isn ' t to bad depend on what you ' re try to do . we be on vacation so we spend more time drive than we ' d like to , a it be quite a way from universal and seaworld , around 30 ish minute . disney be usually around 10- 15 depend on the park . also , a lot of the tourist place and other good food that we tend to visit be on the other side of disney , between it and universal so for most thing it be at least 20 minute away , this be a huge con for u . the front desk people be pretty nice . i speak with two different woman who be really helpful in help me with anything i need . they both speak very good english , which may not seem important to some , but it definitely a plus for me . overall , i probably wouldn ' t stay here again . it could ' ve be much worse , and there be plenty worse in this area , but the combination of the lack of food and distance from everything , and the fact that a disney hotel be only about $ 30 more per night mean we will never come back .",0,737
"on july 7 , our family stay at this hotel for a week . our family and 30 other family stay at this hotel because our child be perform at disney world and universal . we book our reservation through a travel agency and prepay everything . before head to florida , we have some concern about this hotel because of the mix review . we give this hotel a chance after our agent spoke with seralogo . seralogo say they would make sure we be in good hand and if we have any problem they would fix it . from the time we check in , we have horrible service . the room itself be in bad condition . i do a walk through the hotel room . i find numerous fault . 1 ) carpet be filthy2 ) bathroom floor have hair all over . the grout on the floor tile be brown and dirty . 3 ) toilet have hair on the seat4 ) tub be pull away from the wall a you grab the handle to get in the tub5 ) fridge be rust and have a whole in the bottom6 ) furniture be old and mismatched7 ) headboard for the bed be dirty . you could see hand print on the headboard8 ) tube tv9 ) no closet doors10 ) no do not disturb signi go down to the front desk and ask to be move into a different room because i be not satisfy with the room we be give . front desk tell me nothing be available at that time and to come back the next day . we leave a couple day and take our belongs to hangout with family . when we return on the 11th to our room , a stranger be in our room . : / . i go to front desk and an employee name louis ( sp ? ) tell my husband and i that in their policy they have the right to reissue the room if the room look vacant . so i ask to be refund for the two day that they have cancel our reservation . because we go through a travel agency , seralogo employee , louis say we would need to go through the travel agency for a refund . we speak with our travel agent who look into the matter . we be then issue another room . a little cleaner one but not up to my standard . after hear back from our travel agent , seralogo be clueless about this issue . in her eye , they be not take any responsibility . my husband then look on the seralogo website regard the policy of reissue room if the reserve room look vacant . nothing be find . he then call seralogo when we return back from our trip . of course , they give u the run around . 1 ) they say they couldn ' t find any room cancellation ( i have my room number for both room issue before and after it be cancelled. ) 2 ) they tell u we should of inform them when we be leave so the room wouldn ' t be reissue ( sorry . . . that ' s a bunch of b . it ' s prepaid . why would i need to say ? ) 3 ) reservation agent , front desk , and supervisor didn ' t know and could only put the blame on u . it be our fault for not inform them . not only do we make complaint about our room , but a few other family . to sum this up , the customer service and room at this hotel be by far , below a 1 star . i would not recommend anyone to ever stay at this hotel . because this be consider main gate , i really don ' t think disney world would appreciate them use their name with this hotel after the type of horrible customer service and room condition it ' s in . better business bureau should also look into this hotel . i will definitely be contact the owner of the hotel , disney world , and better business bureau if we be not issue a refund for those two day .",0,730

( all of the staff seem to be intentionally look for way to dazzle in their specific area ) . the pool be quite amazing and so much better than any of the photo could capture . we eat the breakfast buffet and then also have lunch at the poolside pavilion which seem quite luxurious . i really enjoy the jerked chicken sandwich and it seem fairly price ( we didn ' t understand other review we have read complain about the price and quality of the food . . . the drink be a little pricey ) and they even cut the crust off the peanut butter sandwich for my daughter . self parking be include in our hotel package ( the resort be quite large . . . think small college campus ) we be local and only spend 1 night but basically enjoy the amenities/ service for the better part of 2 day a staff be clear to u that we could come early and stay late . one of the best part be that there be a nice mix of people there . . . it wasn ' t a bunch of old people and it wasn ' t just a bunch of kid either . . . it be a classy spring break environment with plenty of eye candy : ~ ) ( something for dad ) thing that miss our expectation : we have be look for a resort with water slide for our daughter and while this be a fantastic experience it be different than what we have originally expect . there be 1 water slide and about 20 min wait to ride it and a 42 inch height limit that disappoint our 36 inch daughter . she wasn ' t even allow to ride with a parent . a a side note she be gobble up veggie now so she can be big enough and strong enough to eventually ride ! ! !",1,724
"i ' ll start my review off by say it seem like we be in an older or poorly renovated part of the property because my experience didn ' t match up with a lot of the positive review . my in- law pick this place to stay for a week long trip to orlando . upon check- in there be constant pressure to attend a timeshare seminar and they will call you constantly about it while you be there . initially , the property seem nice but then i start add up all the little issue and decide this place be a bit of train wreck compare to other place i ' ve stay in the area . the nice thing be that our unit have 2 bedroom , 2 bathroom , a kitchen , and live area . that be a good amount of space for 4 adult and a child . each room have a tv and the living room have a dvd player . the pool be keep heated to around 80 degree which be comfortable provide it not too cold outside . they also have outdoor gas grill which we use one night to grill steak . in term of the list of issue , here be the thing that stick out in my mind : - parking lot wasn ' t well attend . many night we ' d come back from disney and have trouble find a spot to park near our building because many other guest park across multiple space . this occur every night we be there and it be the same vehicle each time . - tile in the 2nd bathroom be loose . the tile move when you step on them and the grout be crack . - same bathroom have a clogged toilet the 2nd day we be there . we call maintenance but nobody show up to address the issue . the maid flush the toilet and we come back and find it overflow . we call again and they eventually send someone out to fix the clog and clean the bathroom . - master bathroom bath tub have chip out of it with jagged edge for some reason . - sound proofing be poor . you could hear people walk outside the unit . i could also hear/ feel someone move thing in the unit above most night . maybe they be remodel some of the room at night ? - toaster be break . it would work but you have to sit and hold down the lever . part of the reason for pick the property be to eat meal at the condo but it be problematic . - kitchen be haphazardly stock . there be no spatula and limited cooking instrument . some day we ' d come back to the condo and find new utensil in the drawer . - trash bin for kitchen be undersized . it be the same size a the bathroom trash can so the trash fill up very quickly . a standard sized trash can would have be much better . - pool be not clean when we use it . it be windy and a lot of leaf and debris be settle in the bottom . - pool be not monitor . i wasn ' t expect a life guard but there be a `` quiet pool '' which have sign for no toy or float . guess which pool be full of loud kid with toy and float ? - poor guest relation . aside from try to sell you a timeshare there clearly be no effort to make sure guest have a good stay . the parking issue , the pool rule , and maintenance issue etc be clear indication of that . - wifi be terrible . when i be able to connect i be get about 1mbps up and down . many time i would lose connectivity or get much slower transfer rate . i ' m an it consultant and be try to get some work do while i be there and find the poor internet connectivity hinder that . i would have gladly pay a couple dollar a day for reliable wifi .",0,712
"my fiance and i stay at the dolphin hotel for three night during our recent trip to walt disney world . there be definitely some pro and con , so i ' ll list them out separately : pro : - very convenient to epcot and hollywood studio . we walk to epcot from the hotel and it take u 15 minute each way ( there and back ) . hollywood studio be also within walk distance ( 20 minute ) , but we take a water taxi there ( there ' s also a water taxi to epcot too ) . there be also shuttle to and from magic kingdom and animal kingdom , which run fairly frequently ( on the way to the park , but not on the way back ) . it ' s also within a 5- 10 minute walk of the boardwalk . - amazing restaurant ! we din at both bluezoo ( by todd english ) and shula ' s steakhouse and love both a lot . i will review the restaurant separately and will give them both 5 star . - lovely view . we actually have a view of hollywood studio ' frozen firework show from our hotel room , which be amaze . - early check- in . our flight land around 9am and we get to the hotel by around 10 : 30. we want to drop off our suitcase before we head to epcot ( since we have fast pass early in the day there ) and have expect to just leave them at the bell desk , but we actually be able to check in to our hotel room before 11am . sweet ! - they hold our bag for u on the last day after we check out , but while we be at the park and before we get a shuttle to the airport . - a private and separate shuttle company ( mears ) provide u transportation to/ from universal studio and also take u to the airport . of course , we have to pay fee for that ( $ 22 per person per day ) , but it ' s nice that it stop outside this hotel . con : - terrible service in term of the room . we order towel in the evening and it take an hour and several call to receive them . all we want to do be take a shower after our long day at one of the park , but the staff decide not to help u and we have to dry off use the one clean hand towel we have leave . around midnight , someone who be seemingly a manager finally come by in a huff and hand u some towel . the next day , we didn ' t receive the complimentary stuff we have receive the previous two day ( it seem like that be do out of spite ) . that type of service be unacceptable . - not the most amazing room in term of space and cleanliness , and the bathroom door wouldn ' t shut all the way . also , a very small bathroom and a shower that clog a bit . - not much in the way of casual dining . both of the main restaurant be $ $ $ and $ $ $ $ in term of price range . really good , but it would have be nice to have a more casual option . - there be only a water taxi between this hotel and epcot and hollywood studio . and when it rain / there ' s a chance of lightning , the water taxi do not run . we have to walk back from epcot in the pouring rain because the water taxi be not operate . not fun : ( overall , the dolphin be a good place to stay if you ' re visit disney world . reasonable price , really good early check- in ability , and convenient to several big disney attraction . the service wasn ' t the best , but i would still consider stay there in the future .",0,706
"i be base my rating on the fact that this property advertise itself a a `` resort '' , and i ' m afraid that be far from the truth . we be do a last minute getaway , so we be kind of look to be pamper a bit . i know we be in trouble before we even drive into the `` resort '' . there be no fancy entrance , lush ground or tropical landscaping - just a side road lead into a very big parking lot . upon arrive , we realize there be no bell hop , door man , or valet staff . we leave our bag and go to check in . the vibe here be definitely more like a fairfield suit , or a marriott courtyard . small lobby , smaller breakfast area , and small reception desk . we check in and the woman never say . . . . do you need a cart for your bag ? heck , we didn ' t even see a do it yourself dolly . so here we be schlepping all of our stuff to the elevator and then to our room . there be a hiccup in our `` grand one bedroom suite '' so we have to lug everything back down to the lobby and go up some new elevator to a different room . at that point , i be only experience a self induce sauna moment , a sweat drip off my brow . the `` suite '' be typical homewood or some other moderate brand , the only difference be the amount of storage a this be build a a condo complex during the real estate tumble . the only nice amenity be a tiny balcony , a very large restroom with separate bath/ shower and a washer/ dryer . consider my husband have be on the road for awhile , this come in very very handy . i have no problem when they tell me there be a resort fee , a these kind of property usually have one . but this place didn ' t even offer the most basic of service that a mid- price hotel chain would . besides the front of the house shortcoming , there be no room service or concierge and house keep service be very limited . oh well , it be too late to change hotel and we only have a couple of day so we go off to the pool area and the bar . this part of the hotel be decent , but again , it be surround by a white fence , where beyond it , be just a massive parking lot . i guess if you squint your eye and hum to yourself , you could of imagine yourself at some tropical getaway , until the roar from a passing trucker rattle you back into reality . we get a aaa deal that include breakfast . all i can say be i be glad we didn ' t pay for it . . . . . a it be not automatically include in your stay . it be pretty bare bone , and the big tub of yogurt with a serve spoon plop in the middle just didn ' t seem sanitary . we end up give our voucher away to some folk who didn ' t have the free breakfast . one experience be enough for u . aside from promise of a `` resort '' property , i book this place because of it proximity to universal and because it offer a free shuttle . well upon further inquiry , we find out that the bus leave first thing in the morning and pick up at the park ' s closing time . consider , we have no idea how long we would stay , we be force to drive and pay the $ 15 park fee along with the astronomical admission price . have this place bill itself a a do it yourself , longer stay property , i would have say it be ok. but call itself a resort , leave u very very disappointed .",0,705

"if you have small child , know that you win ' t be in the room too much , on a budget , then the all- star resort be for you . the all- star resort be the `` value '' resort at disney and be aim at family with small child and budget in mind . it be the least expensive of the resort and i feel best disney theme for child . we stay at the all- star music in 2008 and stay in a family suite , and 2010 at the all- star movie in regular room . both be identical in arrangement and overall feel in the hotel room and main lounge . only difference be that music be obviously music theme and everything on the decor be disney and music relate . at the all- star movie , it be more disney movie relate and have statue of disney character . if you be not go to stay in your room all day , and you don ' t need a ritz hotel experience , then the all- star be perfect . the single room come with two full size bed and one bathroom . decorate in disney character decor . the size be perfect for a family of four , with room for a pack- n- play for a little one . think of the all- star a more your standard ramada inn hotel room , but deck out in disney magic . a long a in go in expect this , and not expect another type of room for the price that disney charge for the money , then you win ' t be disappoint . i think most disappointment be because people try to equate the price of the room ( avg . about $ 200/ night ) to something outside of disney for $ 200 , you get a pretty good room at say a marriot . no this be disney you pay more . the price of the room get you free bus transportation all along the property and park . include be park and you don ' t have to drive once you ' re on resort . both time we go to disney , we park , check in , and didn ' t see our car again until it be time to leave . the difference between a standard room and a family suite be that the suite be two room that they merge into one , so you have four bed , two bathroom , and an extra pullout sofa bed . we have six our first trip , that ' s why we need a suite , but a standard room can sleep four and accommodate a pack- n- play . room service be very good , prompt and clean . nothing to complain about , they get the room clean every day and it be do well . every day when we return from the park a new animal be fold for u from napkin or towel . very nice touch . again , think ramada , not hilton . guess service and worker on site be very nice and responsive . there be a video game room , cafeteria , and souvenir shop at the hotel . depend on room , you can either be close to the main lounge , where the bus be , or you can be pretty far . the furthest be still walkable , with furthest one maybe a 5 minute walk . we ' ve since grow out of all- star and move to moderate room because our child be older , but we have no issue whatsoever with stay at the all- star resort when our child be under 7. you ' re at disney from the moment you arrive , to the moment you leave . unlike say at the contemporary or floridian , you do leave disney for a split moment because you ' re not immerse in disney theme the whole time . if you want to be disney 24/ 7 , and save some $ $ $ , then all- star be for you .",1,703
"when my best friend ' s mom ( who be our unpaid , under appreciate , unofficial travel agent ) call u up to tell u that she ' s book the disney ' s all star music resort for a mere $ 70 a night , i be moderately excited . this be much cheaper then what i have originally plan on spending , however know my husband ' s preference for nice hotel , i do worry a bit over the quality of the establishment . however , a quick glance on the website assure me that it wasn ' t run down or flea- bag , but it be definitely a family orient resort . all in all , it be a good resort . the room be smallish , but clean , well kept and i love all the mickey logo everywhere . the housekeeping staff have `` towel art '' to greet u , and the shower have one of those lovely change shower- head so that we could change to `` pulse '' ( my husband ' s preference ) or just normal wide spray ( my preference ) . there be room service of sort - mostly pizza and wing delivery ( from 4pm to midnight ) , and even when we put up the `` do not disturb '' sign during housekeep ' s normal round , they leave u a nice bag of fresh towel and toiletry . how nice ! the gift shop have a lovely snack selection , and a fridge of cold drink ( include beer ! ) in the back , and behind the back register counter , they even sell smoke and liquor . yes , that ' s right - nicotine and booze in mickey- land . hurrah ! next to the gift shop be the pretty vast cafeteria that be open from 6 - midnight . a nice breakfast selection ( the mickey waffle be `` eh '' for me - but definitely worth get at least once ) , and plenty of standard lunch and dinner selection ( pizza , burger , pasta , etc ) . however what i really like about the resort , be how well they plan it , so that it would give parent time to take a breather . every night , there be game , theme , and/ or movie by the poolside that would occupy most 8 - 14 year old easily . family friendly , but more importantly - give those poor parent a break , i be really impress by the set up ( even if the life- guard that be run these event look like they be ready to kill themselves with boredom ) . shuttle bus take u to the various theme park , however , i must say , that while the bus be convenient ( we didn ' t have to rent a car or mess with parking ) , i be a little annoy by the lack of a standardized bus schedule . there be morning that 5 epcot bus would come by in a 10 minute span , but not a single bus would pull through for animal kingdom for 45 minute . frustrate when one be try to catch a specific event or make it to a reservation . i think i would have prefer it if there be set time ( ie 10am , 10 : 15 , 10 : 30 ) that the bus would arrive , so plan would be much easier . i will probably not come back to this resort - even if/ when i have kid - because there really be just * too* many scream kid around ( my best friend have a room that overlook the pool and if she didn ' t bring a white- noise machine , they would not have get any sleep ! ) , however , for family ( or friends or couple ) on a budget , this be definitely a great place to stay . especially for parent who need to get away from the crazy .",0,696

"we stay here shortly to visit universal studio orlando . overall , it be a fairly cheap place to stay if you want to go to universal studio , but there ' s a lot of false advertisement you should be aware of . we would probably not stay here again . location : when book this hotel , we be under the impression that the hotel be very close to the park . it be close if you have a car or shuttle service , but not for walk , a it ' s just over a mile away ( that ' s pretty far in the humid , hot florida weather ) . their website say it be 1/ 2 mile from universal , but that ' s false , unless you want to walk to the edge of the parking lot . within a 5- minute walk , there ' s also a wendy ' s , japanese food , chinese food , a bar , walgreens , and a starbucks , so that be pretty convenient . transportation : here ' s some info we would like to have know beforehand . despite say there ' s shuttle service to/ from universal studio , it be very limited service ( at least during late august ) . there be a single pickup at 8 : 45 be and a single drop- off at 6 : 30 pm . the hotel be pretty small , so it ' s understandable ( we be the only people use the van shuttle ) . it ' s possible to take a shuttle to the doubletree nearby , but you would still need to walk 1/ 2 a mile . i would call beforehand to determine the shuttle time they will have during your visit . the small number of shuttle time be bad if you want to spend a late evening out in universal ' s citywalk after the park close . we have a bad situation with transportation- - we get up bright and early waiting for the shuttle , and wait for another 45 minute after the scheduled pick- up time . after talk with the manager , it turn out an unmarked white van we saw before ( with no marking to indicate it be go to universal ) come and leave without u . after management lie to u say the guy come inside the lobby and call for people to universal studio ( we be in the small lobby the entire time and didn ' t hear anything ) , we complain and he call for the shuttle guy to come pick u up at no charge . make sure you ask your driver what park spot number he will be wait at , or else you will have no way of know how to get back . and be sure to be several minute early , because exactly a the clock turn 6 : 30 , that driver be off ! pool/ amenity : their website have many lie you should be aware of- - it say there ' s a jacuzzi and microwave/ refrigerator/ safe in the guest room . that be complete fabrication- - there be only a small pool , no jacuzzi ; there be a coffee maker , but no microwave , refrigerator nor safe . so yeah , this place be pretty shady . i would confirm they have a list amenity if that be important to you . free breakfast : we admit that the prospect of `` deluxe complimentary continental breakfast '' be the foremost reason for choose this hotel . don ' t expect anything great , but it do have make- your- own waffle , which be pretty cool . they also have a continuous toaster so you can pretend you work at subway . there ' s also coffee/ tea throughout the day in the lobby .",0,664

"we choose this hotel because like it ' s title say , it be nearest universal orlando . this be go to be a very thorough and long review . my apology in advance , but pick a hotel be one of the most important thing about a trip . my partner and i be stay here the first week of 2016 with plan to visit universal orlando . we book six night here and arrive after a really late flight . we plan to rent a car and do stuff on day we didn ' t visit the theme park but our plan be ruin when we both get sick before our arrival . so we end up spend more time in the hotel than i prefer to do ! we be in our early 30 ' s without any kid . we look at the on- site hotel but the cost to stay be a lot and the food option there be expensive . this holiday inn express have a big free breakfast that even dan ( my partner ) be impress by and he ' s a picky eater about quality of food . the shuttle service to the park be a nice perk . we pick this hotel know that it be within walk distance . we do make the walk one evening to the citywalk and my fitbit measure it to be a 22 min . walk one way ( and maybe a little over a mile ) . but after that first day , we decide to take the shuttle and save our walk for inside the park . you should always reserve your shuttle time the day before . the morning of can be sell out , and only on one occasion do we have to stand on the shuttle which drive me crazy because my foot really hurt ( this be the day we walk 8 mile inside the park ! ) . anyways , we like the shuttle service ( wish they have an airport shuttle too ) and the breakfast be top notch . however , the room be very small . we pay average $ 104 per night , and i have stay at holiday inn express in fort lauderdale and nebraska . both of those time , the room be bigger and nicer . but i should caution that this be the first time i have book a hotel for orlando theme park . my last visit , i be 15 year old ( so money meant nothing to me ) . now i be a budget traveler and research so that i get a lot out of a hotel for little cost . so when we get here , i be disappoint with the room . by the end of the trip though , the room size and quality do not make a huge difference . the hotel be close to restaurant , have a big hot breakfast ( which can get crowd ) , and the staff be extremely friendly and helpful . they allow u to move room our first night because of a noise problem . they be so friendly and quick to help u , that it make a huge impact . every time we walk in and out , they smile and say hello . i love that aspect ! in the end , great staff and customer service , good breakfast , shuttle to park , walk distance to restaurant and park , a heated pool ( which we didn ' t get to use because it be actually cold while we be there ) , and this all add up to a good experience . the breakfast alone help save u a lot of money ! definitely would consider stay here again or recommend to our friend !",1,648

"it be a great experience stay here at floridays . we be here for a week during the second week of september . great location on international drive if you choose to not stay at one of the disney or any of the theme resort . there be many great thing about this resort and very few or almost no negative . here be a quick recap : - the room : we have a great 3 bedroom suite on the first floor . the furniture be very well maintain , the kitchen have almost everything one would need for cooking , very well equip with a big fridge , microwave , oven , electric stove top et al . there be an in suite washer dryer too . a huge bathroom with the master bed almost give it a home like feeling . the second bathroom be very big too . help when travel with a big family . our suite use to be clean , spic n span when we return everyday from the theme park . - the pool : one of the highlight of our stay here be the pool . the big pool be super clean and beautifully design , keep the kid in mind . the middle section be the deepest make it extremely safe for the kid and for adult who accompany them to stay vigilant a well . plenty of lounge chair , ample supply of towel , and a smaller private pool near the bathroom . not to forget the in ground hot tub . i didn ' t go near the hot tub because it be so hot in orlando a it be . but it be almost always busy ( capacity of max 6 to seat without be too crowd ) - the bar : again , a great highlight give it be right next to the pool area . they have nightly drink ' special which everyone be enjoy . quite a few tv screen to catch the live game , that could be view while in the pool too . just fantastic set up . oh yes - they play pretty decent tune a well ( whichever sirius radio channel that be on ) . the food menu be extensive and cater to different taste in case you be hungry at an odd hour . - the convenience store : my peep make good use of the convenience store with essential that some have forget to pack . very useful indeed . - front desk / concierge : the staff be very friendly and helpful throughout our stay . we never have an issue with anything . the concierge use to book our daily shuttle to the park for both way . we do have trouble get on return shuttle a couple of time but we get use to it and wasn ' t a big deal . a a word of caution , the return shuttle leave exactly on time and sometimes early . so plan accordingly - especially seaworld and aquatica shuttle . - nearby : there be a huge publix step away from the resort in a nearby strip mall which have other convenience a well - pharmacy , liquor store , restaurant , etc . the i- trolley have a stop on the street to take you to the park or any of the international drive attraction , restaurant , etc . in summary , we will come and stay here again if we aren ' t stay at any of the theme resort . and yes , they have free wifi too that actually be pretty effective . the fact this be a rather new a property , everything seem to work perfectly like a well oil machine . kudos !",1,639
"what a disappointment ! if you think you ' re get hilton quality and service , you ' re in for a rude awakening ! just leave this hotel and will never be return . the pro : we didn ' t notice any dust around our room . counter be clean . the bed seem clean until the 2nd day , there be someone else ' s hair in my `` clean '' bed . it ' s within walk distance to disney spring . benihana be downstairs . the shuttle to disney be free and run pretty timely . the resort fee do include unlimited dvd rental from their machine with a pretty decent selection of new dvd , voucher for free coffee in the market cafe , free shuttle to the park and a coupon book for the surround area . the con : my fiancé be tell upon check in that parking be include in the $ 24 daily resort fee ( which , for the record be one of the most expensive resort fee i ' ve ever encounter in my life ) . when ask for confirmation regard the parking , be tell yes it ' s include and to not worry about it . parking be an additional $ 15- $ 16 a day which they charge u despite what the front desk man say . yes , which be cheaper than most place , but on top of a $ 24 resort fee be ridiculous . when we complain about it , be tell the parking be a third party and they couldn ' t do anything about it . our shower drain didn ' t work properly . every shower we take , we be stand in ankle deep water . we tell the front desk about it twice . it be never fix . our fire alarm in the closet start to beep . be tell by the maintenance man that it be because of the steam from the shower and to give it an hour and then call them back . awesome , a if i want to listen to an annoy beep for an hour only to call you back up here . the coffeemaker be dirty . there be a lot of debris in my cup after the water brew both time . 3 out of 4 towel be stained/ dirty . there be old blood on one of the towel on our last day . our shower curtain be dirty ( which do get replace ) , the bathroom door be peel and fall apart . the carpet be absolutely filthy . felt sticky and grimy on bare foot , my white sock turn brown on the bottom . when we complain to the front desk about the parking issue , we be rudely speak to by a woman with a russian accent , i believe her name be sonia , short thicker blonde lady with a round face and rude demeanor . if you ' re not a people person , don ' t work in hospitality . oh , the free coffee - be hot a sh* t - literally the hottest coffee i ' ve ever have in my life . great way to get a 3rd degree burn on your hand while on the free shuttle to the park ! the $ 24 resort fee be ridiculous . this isn ' t the ritz , and sure a hell no where near that caliber . good place to stay if you ' re look for a free shuttle to the park , but that ' s about it . needle to say , will not be return .",0,626
"this be a review on the hotel , not the club . this place be great for the price . again , for the price . i be judge this place accordingly , a $ 65 a night motel . all these negative comment be untrue . it seem people just have expectation too high . this be motel style hotel , not a hilton . judge it accordingly . the room be clean and keep up . sorry you win ' t get a down feather pillow , but i know i survive . mine have a new sink , shower , and toilet . bed have sheet that be just wash ( you could tell by the smell ) and the furniture be well kept and in perfect condition still . and there be cable tv . this place do not advertise a be a 5 star hotel or a luxury resort . and at $ 66- 70 a night , it ' s great deal ! anywhere else in orlando , especially downtown , will be literally at least twice a much . stay near disney and it will be about three time a much . check the price if you don ' t believe . and not sure what people be talk about say it ' s in a bad neighborhood . perhaps they think orlando be nothing more than beautiful superficial disney hotel , amusement park , and golf course ? the neighborhood be fine , and the location be fine . if you be look for a place to crash for a couple day in orlando and want to be where the gay fun be , this be the place . the price be far cheaper than anywhere in orlando , and it will save you the cost of transportation ( taxi or uber ) if you be plan on drinking . i do the math and stay here save me about $ 350 for a weekend stay in orlando , between what another hotel cost along with have to pay for uber to get back safe after drinking . and the other gay bar be close enough that an uber ride would be affordable if you want to go elsewhere . overall , it ' s a good place to crash for a couple day in orlando if you be look for the gay fun . and i emphasize , for the price of just $ 65 that be a good deal ! if it be any more i would rate it poorly . and if you ' re look for a nice orlando vacation to be close to the theme park , shopping , mall , and other tourist place , don ' t stay here . it ' s a bit remove from all that . pro : - cheap- hotel and club all in one- friendly staff- near plenty of nice local restaurant and coffee shop for day time ( within 5- 10 minute drive ) - oh and it ' s cheapcons : - it ' s not that close to disney if that ' s why you be in orlando , like 45 minute to an hour depend on traffic- some room be still designate for smoking , so be sure to reserve one accordingly- no free wifi they tell me . . . but i do pick up a free signal from somewhere . . . i didn ' t question it- it ' s not a 5 star hotel- if you get a room face the courtyard it might be noisy . but they only put you there if you request it , some people want that to play `` bingo ''",1,626
"my wife and i have visit the jw 2- 3 time a year for the past 5 year . we live just outside of tampa so this be our spot to go to when we want to stay- cay . what we enjoy most about the resort be the excellent service , clean bedroom , balcony view , restaurant and variety of activity that be include in the resort fee . arrive to the property you realize how large and well landscape it be . the valet be always prompt and curteous . the large lobby be a great feature of the property , marble floor , a fountain and i do not know what they pump through the air condition but it always smell so good ! check in be usually a breeze , of the roughly ten time we have stay , they have always upgrade our room to a lake view . there be one occasion where the girl check u in be not feel generous enough to upgrade u but we speak to someone else and they do the following morning . the restuarants be all great . primo be the jw ' s main restaurant . i have notice a slight decline in the food over the year but it be still a great meal , some dish can be too salty , but if you pick the right dish , you will thoroughly enjoy it . primo also have a great wine selection , alot of unique stuff that you wont find anywhere else . service have always be perfect at primo , never once have we have even close to a bad experience . if you play your card right , they might let you taste a variety of their wine . they just open a more casual restaurant on the property that have some nice craft beer on tap . great place to drink a beer and grab a quick snack , though the beer be overprice . one great thing about the property be that you have access to the ritz- carlton just down the hall . at the ritz be norman , which be their flagship restaurant . i would highly recommend eat at norman , we do this for the first time last month and it be fantastic . i have the chef ' s taste menu and it be nne of the best meal ive have . you also have access to the pool at the ritz , if the lazy river be a little too busy for you , the ritz be much more quiet . my wife and i will spend a little time at both . you cant beat the lazy river though , get yourself a drink and float around all day . the hot tub be great a well . include in your resort fee be access to the golf facility . the grande lakes have a great practice facility . i generally spend my morning at the practice facility for a couple hour then head over to the lazy river . if you forget your golf attire or club the clubhouse will provide you with clothes , shoe and the newest model of taylormade club . they have a nice gym and spa a well . at the end of the day , hang out on the balcony and check out orlando light up at night . i recommend get the highest floor possible a the view of the golf course , lake and city be great . the room be clean and neat , bathroom be spacious with a shower and tub , the bed be very comfortable and clean a well .",1,622

"if you ' re in orlando for disney world and/ or universal orlando this be not the hotel to stay in ! they do not have complementary shuttle to either park , they have a shuttle service that pass through that you will have to pay for ! $ 9 round- trip for each person . that ' s not the problem , the problem be the shuttle service only pick up 3 time in the day and they drop off 3 time at night . the earliest they pick up be 8 : 30am and the latest they drop off be 10pm ! some park don ' t close til 11pm- midnight . so you ' re shit out of luck , if you want to stay at the park later , you will have to pay additional for a cab ! that ' s not the only problem , you can not assume that you can just get on the shuttle , you have to let them know 1hr before the scheduled time ! ever since we get here , it ' s be pretty sucky ! we ' re here for the park and we be stick pay for cab every day . this place do not accommodate you , you will have to accommodate them . and on top of that the front desk seem pretty useless . they ' re nice , but that ' s about it . they have no knowledge on anything ! we ask for a cab and instead they call a company they ' re contract with . we want to go to downtown disney , which be only 3 mile away and he charge u a flat rate of $ 17 ! ! ! ! that be insane ! that be the only and last time we ask the front desk for anything . i understand people be on a hustle to make money . i get it . at least be nice and slick about it . make u feel good . but we a tourist feel cheat ! we have only meet 2 honest cab driver from this whole trip and we ' ve ask them for they ' re direct number and we ' ve be contact them for ride . and because they ' re good people we tip them fat ! the front desk will not recommend any other service that isn ' t theirs . you be on your own . if you be here for the resort ; sure it ' s nice , big pool , nice and clean room , starbucks coffee , huge property , gym , laundry , arcade , etc . i pick the wrong resort for our trip . point of this review , do yourself a favor and pick a resort inside the walt disney area . there be no resort fee here , but all the cab/ shuttle rid fee accumulate . the air- headed front desk give u both a headache , it ' s not worth it . might a well pay the resort fee inside the walt disney resort and be accommodate . disney be know for their customer service and i wish we could reschedule this trip all over again . we ' ve be find our own way , by call around . local cab , local transportation , look at map , ask local , etc . it ' s a good learning experience , but we ' ve learn our lesson . just because it ' s a nice hotel , doesn ' t mean the people run it be smart .",1,615
"i think this be a fantastic hotel for the price . no , it ' s not the marriott ( a hotel another reviewer compare it to ) , but i think it ' s definitely in line with the quality of the `` economy '' disney hotel , which be slightly more expensive and smaller in size . my family of 5 stayed here this past weekend - we be look for a basic hotel near disney that would fit all 5 of u in 1 room . i also want a hotel that have shuttle to the disney park ( to avoid pay for park ) and also a free breakfast ( to save money on that meal , know i ' d end up spend a ton inside the park ! ) . the buena vista suite meet all of these criterion and we be very happy . the room itself be the perfect size for hubby , myself and our 3 kid ( age 9 , 7 and 5 ) . have the `` living room '' with a door that separate it from the bedroom give my husband and i the flexibility to stay up and watch tv after the kid have go to bed . . . . the 2 bed be very comfortable - however the sofa bed in the living room be awful ! the mattress be thin and warp and not very comfortable to sleep on . we end up have my 9 year old son sleep on it after hubby and i truly discover how horrible it be after we ' d try to sleep there on night 1 . ( we ' d move our son from the regular bed onto the sofa bed later at night when hubby and i be ready to go to sleep ourselves. ) since our son be only 9 , the sofa bed mattress didn ' t bother him at all and he sleep fine there . the free breakfast be great ! there be a buffet of all the regular breakfast stuff - scramble egg , pancakes/ waffles/ french toast ( depend on the day ) , sausage/ bacon , hot and cold cereal , and bagels/ muffins/ donut . we be all happy ( and full ) when we head for the park . the shuttle to the park be the one thing i wasn ' t really `` thrill '' with . yes , there be one . but there be literally one bus that circle through all of the park before head back to the hotel . ( a oppose to disney operate bus which be park- specific and go back and forth between the hotel and 1 park only ) , so depend on where you get on/ off , you could end up on the bus for close to an hour before you get to your destination . also , the shuttle only run every 2- 2 . 5 hour , so you don ' t have a lot of flexibility on when you can go/ return . ( ex - the morning shuttle take you to the magic kingdom at either 8 : 00am or 10 : 00am - the option for return from magic kingdom be either 7 : 00pm or 9 : 30pm ) . give the schedule and the length of time we spend on the actual bus itself on day 1 , we decide to just drive to the park and pay for park ( $ 20/ day ) for the rest of our trip , rather than use the hotel shuttle bus .",1,612
"first off , let me say that aside from one ( major ) issue , the international palm resort & amp ; conference center would have be an ok place to spend the one night my friend and i be in orlando ( march 2014 ) . the resort be locate right across the bridge from universal studio , and the lobby and convention center both look nice . after read some review and do some sleuthing , the friend in charge of book our stay request our room in the tower , since they be say to be the more `` modern '' of the hotel ' s amenity . the room themselves be your basic , generic hotel room ; two queen bed , carpet , an actually decent- sized fridge and a bathroom . grant , our bathroom be a little dingy and the toilet have a small leak from the bottom , but it be fine for the single night we be stay . we drop our stuff and head to the pool , which be actually really pretty and not super crowd later in the afternoon . i do have an incident when a little kid walk in just a i finish use the bathroom ; apparently the pool bathroom lock be out of commission that day and no one think to warn the patron . we browse through the gatorworld park before head back upstairs , which be interest and a fun way to pass a few minute . for $ 5 you can throw the gator food , which i ' m sure be a blast for older kid . a i note , we go out to universal that night and everything seem fine until the next morning when , upon open her eye , one of the girl notice something crawl across her white bed linen . upon further inspection , that something be , with 100 % certainty , a bed bug . we have do a cursory check before bring anything into the room ( a anyone should , regardless of the hotel ' s reputation of star- status ) , but apparently we have miss something , a a second bug turn up on top of the mattress upon further inspection . we contain them both and bring them to the front desk upon our ( quick ) exit . i will say - - the staff be incredibly accommodate and go out of their way to apologize and rectify the situation . they refund u immediately and continue to ask if there be anything else that they could do . unfortunately , the onus be then on u to make sure that our stuff hadn ' t be infest , but thankfully , due to our own vigilance ( and keep our stuff on hard surface during the majority of our stay ) , we didn ' t bring any unexpected souvenir home with u from orlando . i would give the palm the second star because they be quick to recognize this massive fault , but the hassle of have to wash and dry all of my belonging on hot while on vacation be still too fresh in my memory . i wouldn ' t say to necessarily avoid the palm if you already have a reservation , but definitely do a thorough check of your room for bed bug prior to bring your stuff in . while the front desk be very apologetic and understanding , i can ' t stress enough how important it be to check everything if you be stay here .",0,610

"our stay at the dolphin do not really live up to our expectation . i really expect better from a aaa 4 star hotel . when they first open it be probably very nice but imho they could use an update . we check in later in the evening and have to wait because there be only one person at the front desk . for a hotel this size this be unexcusable . the room be small to average size and seem clean ( although not sure about the sheet ) . there be a nice view of the resort from our room . when we turn down our bed there be several coarse black hair in the sheet ! it be possible that the sheet be clean and the hair fell while be make up but this be a major turnoff obviously . we be exhaust from travel all day so we clean the hair off the sheet and crash out . we be awaken bright and early by noise from the hallway . despite a big convention go on in the hotel , there be also lot of kid in the hotel , after all , this be disney . but surprisingly , the noise wasnt come from the kid , it be come from hotel staff and housekeeping , who be have loud conversation in the hallway . this coincide with the loud slamming of room door , which be pretty much constant during housekeep hour a they come in and out of room during cleaning . ( whatever happen to the old fashioned door stop ? ) . we order a high price room service breakfast which come with `` breakfast potato '' ( home fry ) . the other dish be fine but the home fry be disgust , wrinkle up , mushy and overcook a if they have be sit around for day and reheat over and over . they also have a sour taste . i be starve but decide i better not eat them . i call room service and tell them i think the potatoe dish have go bad . the attendant call me back in 5 minute and tell me that the chef check it out and indeed they have go bad . the sent me 2 new side dish free of charge obviously . nonetheless , allow something that be so obviously rotten ( you could tell by look at it ) to be serve to a guset just wouldnt happen in a real 4 star hotel . go to fire up my laptop and find out there be a $ 14/ day charge for internet ! thats a rip off in my opinion . on our last day we be exhaust and we oversleep . i call and ask if we could check out 1 hour late and be treat very rudely . they act like i be ask for the world and although they reluctantly agree they also sternly tell me that anything past 1 hour late we would be charge for a day . gee thanks . again , not the level of customer care i expect from a 4 star hotel . agin , i expect more from the sawn/ dolphin . this be my first time at the dolphin and for this stay and the experience we have , i reluctantly have to rate our experience at 2 1/ 2 star but couldnt honestly round up on this one . p . . . the italian restaurant in the swan be very good .",0,600
"ok first off i need to say thank you to tori at the front desk . she be the shining star during our initial time at the hotel . we be frequent traveler to universal hotel . a youfirst platinum member we be entitle to perk that usually put this property over the top . the primary benefit a a platinum member be the suite upgrade at time of reservation . unfortunately the reservation agent must not understand this and tell u that we need to request the upgrade at check in . unfortunately at check in to a sell out hotel , suite be unavailable . this be a big disappointment a it should have be handle correctly in the first place . travel with a baby in a standard room be not enjoyable . there be several other perk that come along with this type of membership that again be overlook on this visit . no turn down service water , no newspaper , no welcome gift . we have to request the welcome gift that have apparently be downgrade from delicious cooky and milk to 3 piece of fruit wrap in cellophane on a plate . yes , healthier but much le enjoyable for kid . i don ' t mean to sound snobbish but when you demonstrate the brand loyalty we have , it be disappoint not to be thank . that be the bad . . . now some good ! very clean . . the hotel have always be clean , but the management must have see the recent expose on hotel cleanliness because the room be immaculate . they smell clean , and to the eye they be spotless . the staff be extremely pleasant . we just spend several day on disney property for my daughter birthday and the staff here blow them away . i could not be more pleased to see that level of professionalism come to universal hotel . the restaurant be good not great but they can compete with any on property din establishment include city walk option . if you want to dodge the crowd and enjoy a good meal stay at the hotel and walk it off on your way to city walk for the party . breakfast in the lobby be convenient and very pleasant . i promise you will not be disappoint . the pool at royal pacific definitely lend itself to family time . sit by the zero entry pool and enjoy a few cocktail when kid of any age enjoy the water . drink be very good and the food have the variety and quality of any resort on property . don ' t miss the dive in movie for some extra quasi babysitting time . check out be almost right . again the youfirst reward provide for a $ 100 food/ spa credit . this be not apply and we have to remind them to apply it . so here be how i rat this stay . one star for cleanliness , one star for staff , one star for amenity . i take one star off because of the slip ups on reservation and perk that be miss and minus a star for the missed credit at check out . yes i definitely recommend this property for anyone that be travel to universal . i will go a far a to recommend it over the other 3 hotel on property . we have stay at all of them and rp provide more value and convenience than the others .",1,599

"awful . just awful . apparently , i didn ' t check the review for this place out when book our stay , because if i have , i would not have stay there . our party decide to make the road trip down to orlando with one purpose in mind : visit the universal studio ( specifically , the wizarding world of harry potter ) . we discover this ramada through the universal website a an affiliated hotel , and find that the overall trip ( hotel and universal ticket ) would be much more affordable than buy the ticket and a different hotel separately . i will never make the mistake of be undiscriminating with my hotel choice again , a we be all extremely disappoint with our stay . the funny thing be , we have just come from stay at a relatively poor hotel in panama city beach , but after stay at this ramada , our memory of pcb become a little bit more rose- colored . good : honestly nothing . bad : - front desk staff be incredibly understaffed . - room be tiny . how they squeeze two bed , desk , armchair , and a dresser into that unit be beyond me . - we walk into the room and immediately notice a puddle of water underneath the a/ c unit near the window . we ' re talkin ' squishy carpet here , folk . i think it might have be because the window be open during the storm that have take place the day before , but it be clearly from something else . we call the front desk to have someone repair it , and the following day ( ! ! ! ) a guy come in with a stack of towel and just hand them to a member of our party . problem solve ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : d : d : d- the pool be absolutely disgust . i ' m pretty sure that it was/ be 99 % urine , 0 . 9 % rain water , and 0 . 1 % pool chemical . - the shuttle . a i mention earlier , we travel to orlando with the sole purpose of go to universal studio . we stay here because of it universal affiliation , and the promise of have a free shuttle to the park . not only be it two hour late , but the hotel staff fail to mention to anyone that it have break down on the way to pick all of u up , leave u to just sit outside in the 100 degree heat . we bring all of this up to the front desk staff when we check out , hop that they could take some money off , or apologize , or something . we be meet with defensiveness and the knowledge that their staff be unable to do any sort of financial adjustment ( ridiculous ) so we ' d have to wait to be contact by a manager . we didn ' t hear from the manager until a few day later , when he graciously offer to refund our entire stay . okay , so the only good thing about our stay be that we didn ' t have to pay for it . awesome !",0,576

"my bestie and i stay here for two night prior to a cruise . we choose a universal resort hotel because of the fact that we would get early entry into the wizarding world of harry potter at island of adventure . we choose this particular hotel because my friend love hawaii and polynesian style decor . we book directly through universal with a package that give u park hop ticket with front of the line pass since we really only have one day at universal and want to maximize our time in the park . we arrive somewhat late on a wednesday evening after fly all day from california . we check in and be upgrade to a jr. suite . we have originally book a two queen standard , but my best friend and i be not adverse to share a king bed , we have do it before . we could have sleep someone on the pull out in the living room , but with both of u have back issue , we decide not to chance it . the room itself be spacious and clean with a nice view of all the lush vegitation outside . the bathroom be a little small , but functional and nice that the sink be outside the toliet/ shower area . we head downstairs to eat dinner in the lounge , which serve sushi and other asian inspire dish . the cocktail there be fantastic , but the sushi be only okay . service be excellent however . afterwards we decide to walk along the path to universal citywalk and stake out everything for the next day . the walk be nice and easy and pretty along the water with lot of plant and flower . we actually prefer walking over the complementary boat that run during theme park hour . only because it be faster to walk than take the boat . if we have our kid with u and they be tire at the end of a long day , then we might have appreciate the boat more . when we get back we decide to track down some dessert and go to the american bar/ restuarant downstairs . it be okay , everything from service to decor to the food be not a good a the sushi lounge on the lobby level . after our long day at the universal park , i be not feeling very good and need to pick up some medication at the nearby walgreens . i head out to the front to ask for a taxi and valet call for me , but apparently there be some sort of cab shortage at that moment , so the valet be kind enough to drive me to walgreens and back . i make sure i leave him a generous tip . on our last morning we decide to have room service breakfast and we call it in and it be deliver just a i be do with my shower . it be pretty good a far a room service food go . overall we be happy with our stay here and would stay again if we be spend time at the universal resort , it be definitely worth it if you want to get into the park early and get on the ride a quickly a possible .",1,564

"we do not know when we make our reservation that this hilton be sell timeshares of it room . we think it be just another hilton , part of the hotel chain . we have reserve two room side by side , instead we be give two room diagonal to each other . our floor have the timeshare model suite , we have to experience from early morning onwards , group of prospective client be parade through our floor by the sale staff , not very friendly staff either . the wall be so thin that the family in the next room , the one with the connect door to our room , have a child that star pitch a tantrum from the moment they arrive . my better half and i understand such tantrum have raise two kid , but this tantrum be non- stop all evening . we could hear the parent yell at the child to shut- up ! and he never do . after two hour , we call the front desk only to be tell that `` baby '' can have bad day , only this be no baby , and that we should just deal with the noise . we explain that we have be patient , that this be not a baby , the staff agree half heartedly to take care of it . i don ' t think they do because this be repeat again the next evening . i sympathize with the parent , but seriously , no one need to hear this for hour at a time at a hotel , this one not so cheap either . the pool area be nice , but no designated adult swim area , so be prepare for unattended kid to jump in at any time . the gym be very small . the one main reason we will never go back : they provide complimentary ear piece to plug into the exercise machine . you put the used one into a bin . we saw one of the service staff take the used ear piece , wrap up the wire , and put them back into the basket for future use by other patron . we have no clue that the ear piece have be wear by other patron , how gross be that ! we do mention this to the front desk , they just shrug it off . we also ask for water cup in the gym , they have a water dispenser , but no cup . one hour later , still no cup . the one positive point : they have an on- site deli that make marvelous food . they have all the item that a tourist might need for a brief stay in a new city . a bit expensive , but you have to pay for convenience . it be obvious from our brief stay that the main purpose of this hilton be to sell timeshares ; they be pretend to be a hotel for now to rent out the room , but they don ' t behave like a hotel and the hotel guest be completely ignore . they also do not honor be member of the hilton honor program . obviously , we will never stay there again .",0,556
"just stay here with my husband and kid . the room lay out be ok for what we need . however it be not a clean a i would expect . you can clearly see where the vacuum reach . towel be not replace , they take the dirty one but we would have to ask for new clean one . also why would house keep knock on the door at 9 pm at night ask if we need towel ? put clean towel in a room should be a give . if you take dirty one provide clean one . we have a wonderful long day at seaworld to return to tower 2 at about 5 pm to find two fire truck infront . i don ' t blame the hotel for the incident but i do blame them for the lack of concern to all of u want to get i to our room . they provide zero information a to when they think we could return and what be actually happen . from chat with other guest stand outside the building we find out someone set off a smoke detector on the 10 th floor which have set off sprinkler and cause water to run down to a far a the 6 th floor . hotel staff come in and out and offer nothing more then the fire marshal just arrive it be up to him a to what will happen . i felt they should have offer all of u stand outside , a place to go sit and wait with water , and or some complementary snack . i have two 5 1/ 2 year old with me that be hot and tired and be look forward to a swim . but that never happen . we be let back in the building at about 7 : 15 pm but be never tell any information . the elevator we out no staff be to be find to offer direction . i have to call the front desk to talk to two different people two day later when we be check out to see if they be offer any compensation for the major i convince and they say yes , $ 50 buck . i would have think they would have offer a little more . a when i have stay at a hotel in the bahamas and the power go out for all of 2 minute they give u beautiful travel bag to each room . the staff be not very friendly except for one man name mr. joseph in maintenance he be the only staff member that would say good morning or afternoon to u . the other we would pass not even a smile . it be very clouded but the pool and there be sign tell people to not stand at the bottom of the water slide . but it be pack with people swim , stand and play catch . they have a person at the top of the slide tell people when they can go they need another at the bottom to keep it safe for the people come down the slide and the people at the bottom in my opinion . i would never recommend this hotel and will never be return .",0,554

"my little brother tell me about this gem . with brian be an leo , he get a special discount , which be go to save u a pretty decent amount . so , naturally we book it ! first let me say , i hate hotel that charge you to park . and this place do . it be just stupid ! if they feel the need to charge people to park on their property , just add it to the price of the hotel ! hide that crap , and then it win ' t tick people off ! with this park thing , it drop our saving a bit . but still a saving , none the le . however , a i be stand at the counter i hear the little guy tell someone on the phone that he will give them park for half of what we pay ! not nice doubletree , not nice ! when you walk in , it ' s beautiful in the lobby . there be a bar smack dab in the middle of the lobby . kinda neat . several seat area in the lobby to watch the huge projection screen tv . although , we didn ' t hang out there . plenty to do at this place . mini golf , ping pong , fooseball , pool table , chess , cornhole , movie at night , three pool , several restaurant . there be a couple of hammock between building one and three , and a sit area with a small fire pit . in my opinion , the best building to stay in be one , two , three , four . . . those be the one nearest all of the fun stuff . we stay in the tower . our tower room be nice ! smelled very clean when we walk in . looked clean , i have no complaint . we have be tell that they just go through a renovation , and you could tell . there be no microwave or fridge in the tower room . but you can pay extra for them . i think that be silly because the other room come with them at no additional charge . our bathroom be clean , plenty of towel and have all the little shampoo and stuff that normal place have . you could tell that the tile and tub area have not be reno ' d but it didn ' t bother me . it be clean . well , except for that big smear of something on the back of the bathroom door . but it wasn ' t enough to freak me out . my by mention that he think the carpet need to be replace . i think they be fine . it ' s a hotel , with lot of foot traffic . it be go to look a little worn . it wasn ' t raggy or anything . it be fine really . i suppose my only complaint will be the stink parking fee . oh . . . don ' t forget your chocolate chip walnut cooky ! they be delicious ! we stop at the front desk every day to get more !",1,552
"come here for a conference and stay for 5 day . the hotel itself be pretty nice , practically the size of a la vega casino but i leave frustrate . the hotel itself do not have shuttle service to and from the airport . a cab cost $ 60 dollar one way . so i opt to rent a car for the day think that with a rental for about $ 30 a day it would basically cost the same a the cab fare there and back . if you aren ' t go to provide transport please do not charge such an insane amount for park . i ' m screw if i get a cab and i ' m screw if i rent a car . park cost $ 18 dollar a day plus tax . this isn ' t downtown chicago , this middle of nowhere orlando , where there be ton of space . i end up spend $ 120 on parking . arghhhhhhh ! ! ! ! there be 6 restaurant there . most drink cost about 10+ and one roll of sushi will run you about $ 15. there be a coffee place with sandwich which would probably cost you around $ 10 and your quickest option . otherwise go to the buffet would run you $ 20 and up depend what meal it be . there be an adult only pool which be pretty nice , and also a kid mini waterpark area that be cute . the adult pool isn ' t really watch which i figure be fair but maybe a drop in once in awhile by management would be nice . there be a lady there everyday with her baby . also leave her baby unattended to do other stuff ! ! we be at the adult only pool because we do not want to hear baby cry . don ' t get me wrong i love baby , but i ' m at the adult pool for a reason . the hotel have a impressive biodome which be basically the center . so while huge and a little confusing if you keep walk in a circle you will get where you need to go . the room however be not that impressive . they be just okay and provide what you need but i didn ' t walk in be like wow totally worth the $ 150 . 00 ( special conference rate ) a night . they just seem so bland when i walk in , the color scheme and decoration really weren ' t extraordinary . i be bother that one of my pillow actually have a body pillow cover on it , the excess of the body pillow be stuff into the case to make it look like a regular pillow . i be wonder for half the night why my pillow be so crunchy and wrinkly . why would you do this ? ? ? ? not enough regular pillow case ? my tissue be almost empty for 2 day and never replace . i be really excite to stay here . i leave feel like my pocket be turn inside out and didn ' t sleep very well cause of extra crunchy pillow .",0,551
"the sheraton vistana be a mixed bag of high quality room and ground mixed with perplexing service and food inconsistency . the place be beautiful . the suite my family rent have a nice kitchen , washer/ dryer , jacuzzi , bose tv speaker , beautiful interior and all the creature comfort we could want . we like the open floor plan and color scheme of the bedroom so much we be think about duplicate it when we remodel . a our stay progress ( 4 night book by costco travel ) we notice that they seem to have put all their money into quality part but skimp on installation and maintenance . we pull a mug out of the cabinet which be cake with dried food a be all but 2 of them . there be old food under the couch which be really disturbing and gross . the only restaurant that offer room service ( very limited menu and service hour ) be confuse about their own menu and the food be not close to the quality we experience at other hotel . the other restaurant serve the same strangely poor quality food . on the last day we be exhaust so after swim we order a burger , fry and chicken strip because it be next to the pool . i watch a my daughter chicken strip and fry fell out of the box in to the ledge when the cook try to slide it through the window and he look right at me , scoop them up and put them back in the box . the waiter have a new order make when i point it out to him . then there be the curious hard sell , strong arm tactic they use to try to get u to attend a sale pitch we assume be design to sell u a time- share ! what ? unbelievable , uncalled for and unprofessional . the wait for check- in be unacceptable and now we know it be because the plentiful staff be busy strong- arm people who be simply try to get to their room . they walk people to 3 different station to try to wear u down . after a 5 hour flight and 10 hour day get there they make u wait almost 2 hour to finally give u the key . i keep tell them my family be very tired and hungry and we simply want to go to our room . the staff seem to be under order to give the spiel and get u to that sale pitch ! never experience that before . on the plus side , most of the staff be delightful . the amenity , other than the food be top notch . clay and hard court tennis court , basketball court , more pool than you need and an awesome transportation company . it felt like they open this place before they be really ready . they need to take a hard look at their policy , and management over site if they want to be a 4 or 5 star resort and compete with other resort in the area and there be a ton of them . we highly recommend universal orlando though !",0,549
"thought on my recent disney trip and their treatment of guest with disability . . . earlier this year , a lot of people have negative thing to say about disney ' s decision to change their policy regard access ride for disabled guest . unfortunately , some le than morale people would hire disabled guest to escort them through the park so those unscrupulous people could quickly jump in front of people in line . a a result , disney change the policy to try and end that practice but still allow guest with disability to be able to enjoy the ride . guest and parent be up in arm and very vocal about how this be a terrible way to treat disabled people . they be cry foul before they even try the new process . a a person who need a scooter to get around the park and not able to stand in line the whole time ( due to my broken foot ) , i can report how disney ' s new policy work and what i think of it . to summarize it , guests with disability may go to any ride that offer a fastpass+ and request a `` scheduled return time '' . what disney do be look at how long the line it and give you a return time 10 minute earlier than if you have wait in it the whole time . so , if the line be 65 minute long , i will have a scheduled return time 55 minute later . this seem simple enough , right ? well , time to put it to practice . i go up to the fastpass+ entrance the first time ( seven dwarf mine ) . the wait in the standby line be 80 minute . i roll up , ask about the scheduled return time . the cast member be more than happy to scan my magicband , and ask how many in my party would be join me on the ride . i tell her all three , and voila , i have a return time 70 minute later . i think i spend more time speaking to her about where she be from ( north carolina ) and how disappointing the football season be : ) during those 70 minute , we check out attraction , ride some other ride and when it come time to return , we go right though the fastpass+ line . no problem . we experience this at all of the park ( except hollywood studio ) . that be because when we arrive on friday , i do not know about this service and do not inquire about the benefit ( no fault to disney ) . at tomorrowland , i go to the different ride and setup my return time . by the time i be do with that , we be able to go back- to- back- to back rid all the ride . in summary , i still believe disney go out of it way to try and ensure that all guest have a `` magical '' time and while no process be perfect , they try their best to support everyone ' s need .",1,546
"during spring break we take our kid to disney orlando . since one of our child have a disability , we stay at the disney boardwalk inn ( 2 night ) for convenient access to the theme park . we pay 5 star price for a 1 star experience . our room be dirty when we arrive . the white bedspread have clearly visible body hair all over them . perhaps they be throw on the dirty floor and put back on the bed ? for about an hour we wait while the housekeeper complete an entire bed linen change . when we check back she have the bed strip but be talk on the phone . she ask for another 15 minute . after a 3 hour flight we simply want to relax and change out of our travel clothes but we need a room to have our luggage deliver to . there be parlor type seat area by the elevator on each floor . my back be hurt from the 3 hour flight and i desperately need to sit down but the seat of the chair have what appear to be streak mark on it ; i stand instead . one would think that a 5 star resort would have plenty of restaurant with somewhat easy access . resort guest need dinner reservation to dine at the restaurant . the automated reservation line didn ' t work ; on hold 15 minute for a live person . the only time available be after 8 : 30pm . walk around we find that there be very limited option to have a nice somewhat quick meal with child ; pizza by the slice ? this resort wasn ' t crowd at all . i can ' t imagine what get into a restaurant be like during the summer . there be nothing much to do after dusk . the small arcade close at 10 : 00 and the dance hall wasn ' t open sunday or monday night . really ? my teenage son be bore so we decide to watch a movie in our room . but boardwalk inn doesn ' t offer on demand movie ! unreal . but they have many disney channel to advertise and promote everything disney . magical experience ? hardly . the next day we go to the park . upon return to our room , nothing have be clean and we be out of clean towel . we hadn ' t notice any sign in the room state that the resort didn ' t clean room unless request . one sell point of stay at the resort on the disney property be the fast pas . this allow you to reserve a time for specific attraction in theme park . so many people use it that the reservation time could be 4 or more hour out . not a perk . i ' ve come to the conclusion that while get ready for your relaxing vacation at home , clean packing , arrange pet sitter , you also need to plan every move of your disney vacation ; make dinner reservation and fast pas reservation . we have none of these issue while stay universal studio property !",0,546
"this be a value resort not a five star resort , so i expect it to not be amaze like the luxury resort that be also on disney world property . we didn ' t care to stay at a nice spot because we be go to spend all day from 8am- 10pm out and about at the park anyway . we just want a place to sleep and shower that be on disney property . the hotel lobby itself be nice and clean . the staff be very friendly and helpful ( it be my boyfriend and i ' s first time here at disney world ) . our room be sort of far from the main building , but whatever we do get what we pay for so i didn ' t complain about it . our room come with two bed , a table , a tv , fridge , and safe . the safe be big enough to fit my large wallet that i do not want to carry around the park , my extra pair of sunglass , a well a my makeup bag and my boyfriend itouch . not big enough for a laptop , which should not be bring anyway in my opinion . we leave our do not disturb sign at the door all week , because we be not dirty people . we make our own bed and take out our garbage and dirty towel so we didn ' t feel like we need housekeep at all . but the first 4 day there , they do leave a bag with 4 body towel , 2 face towel , and a few mini towel a well a toiletry . all of those be more than enough for u to last our whole weeklong vacation there . the shuttle for the park get there every 7- 10 minute . it take about 15- 20 minute to get to your destination , because the bus driver do not want to speed their way through . we do not eat the hotel food because we bring our own snack and want to eat in downtown disney and at the park instead . but we quickly find that we get so tired of american food by the third day , so we go to wal- mart and buy some cup noodle and fruit to stash in our fridge . a few of the day there we bring home leftover from during the daytime so we stash it in the fridge and microwave it in the morning for breakfast . the hotel food look like cafeteria food , which be no surprise at all it be a value resort people lol . if you want amaze food then go to a different resort where you pay more . the pool be clean , they ' re open daily from 9am- 11pm . unless there ' s a major rain storm or something . so if you ' re look for a place to only shower , sleep , and don ' t care for fine meal , then this be the place for you ! if you want more such a spa and such , then check our their luxury hotel .",1,546

( of course no one be in there ) . so clean and modern the woodwork be dark and the combination of tan and blue be beautiful . our room be upgrade with a balcony which i love . one thing we do learn and everyone should do the same be bring in food supply , say for breakfast , such a cereal and milk with some fruit to make your day go faster and le expensive . the first day we be there we go down to the lower lobby for breakfast and there be what i thought be a family friendly restaurant for a fast breakfast . but i be wrong . the buffet style breakfast cost around 17 . 00- 18 . 00 per person and there be no sharing of food . if you order from the menu it almost come out the same so we all three have a waffle which also be expensive . on the first night when we arrive we order room service , 2 chix strip dinner and 1 caesar salad 2 glass of pinot grigio . the bill be 90 . 00 so when we go to walmart for some snack , drink and breakfast item i buy a whole bottle of pinot grigio for 8 . 00 plus many snack and breakfast cereal and milk to lengthen our day instead of spend our morning at a restaurant and spend a lot of money . the room have a safe for your valuable and a hidden refrigerator . very nice . the pool be great . we be a little turn off from the many foreigner there that do not care about cleanliness while in the pool . many spit in the pool , one gentleman from japan or china come in the pool with his underwear under his swim trunk . many blow their nose in the pool and we even saw a woman have her little girl stand on the lounge chair and urinate and then take her into the pool . i could not believe our eye . from that point on we do not use the pool . otherwise the bar service near the pool be great but beware it ' s still expensive . we find a subway and our lunch be 8 . 00 vs. 80 . 00 at the pool . a the week go on the restaurant become more empty , i guess guest figure it out . the week there be great otherwise . i give them a five star .",1,539
"this place be now rename `` great value suite '' . they say it ' s under new management and they have renovate it . this be my first time here and my last . i can not believe how disgust they keep it here . i have hear really bad horror story about this hotel but it be still bad . i heard there use to be a swimming pool some year ago but this hotel no longer have one . pro : they have a big refrigerator . my ac unit work well and cold . price be reasonable . maid service be once a week . the good part about the maid service so far i like be that i don ' t need to leave my room when they come to clean which be good cause i hear the maid tend to be thief here . maintenance have be good at fix problem with the tv but the stove never work properly which lead me to have to either out or use other method for cook my meal . the laundry room so far wash and dry pretty good . they do close around 9 pm . you can ' t leave your clothes unattended though cause they will get steal . con : they have security here yes , but they run it more like if they be play cop and robber like kid . there be video camera in every corner watch everyone , literally . just because there might security in a place , it doesn ' t mean it be safe . there be cop , ambulance and the fire department come here almost on a daily basis , mostly because the security here mingle way too much with the client and like i say , they tend to act more like cop and correctional officer instead of do there job solely a security at a hotel . there be no smoking inside anywhere or in the room . even outside you can not in the hall area . the reason be they want to make sure they watch you smoke on the security camera . make no sense to me . i have see them play with the child right in the hallway in the hotel make all kind of noise . most of the resident who live be spanish . there be wi- fi but the connection be way too slow . most of the time i couldn ' t even get to the internet cause it take forever to bring any page up . the infestation of roach that run amuck here give me the creep on how unsanitary a hotel can be . i spend more time just try to kill these cockroach which come in all size and they just keep come . in general , they have a no pet policy , and rent be only paid weekly which require a $ 50 deposit plus the week rent . many of the worker here be spanish so they tend to gossip behind your back when they think you don ' t understand . mainly the maid and security people whom be very nosy .",0,538
"the positive : check in be fast and easy , and when we have to change room , they do so quickly and without resist our request . the negative , and the list be long : our first room ' s bathroom smell like sewage ( thus the request to change room ) . the bed be uncomfortable , and bounce excessively when either of u roll over . it felt like a cheap , old mattress . the place be a little run down feeling in the room and hallway , though the lobby be attractive . the outside entrance require a room key to enter after 6pm , but several of them dont even work , leave u run around in the rain try to get in . though there be internet in the room it be very slow . unacceptably slow . we use our cell phone a hotspot rather than use theirs . one on day , the staff never bother to come to the room until about 5 pm , and then just offer my husband towel , and never clean the room . the cleaning/ maid staff be quite noisy , prevent any sleeping in . ( strangely , we saw them and hear them in the hallway every morning , but even on the day the room do get clean , it be often very late. ) we do not eat at any of the hotel ' s restaurant , but i be attend a conference at the convention center , which include meal , and they be mediocre and dull , like any bad buffet . we ask for a late check out , since my class at the convention center go until 12 : 30 , and we ' re decline . how often do a hotel deny you a slightly late check out ? ? when call to inquire about a late check out we ask for a confirmation of charge . there be an extra $ 9 bar fee on our bill , and when i tell her it be an error , she say she would look into it . the next morning it be still not fix , so i tell the front desk ( again ) that we have use no bar or restaurant , and ask her to fix it so that i could get to class . she say she `` could not take my word for it '' and would need to pull the receipt to check the signature , and would need to get back to me . this alone be insulting , but since i have to go to class , i also ask her to call the room after 9am with her `` research '' into their error , so a not to wake my husband . dispite this , she call the room at 8 be , wake him up . in summary , i would strongly recommend against this place . i can not comment on the value for the money , since it be pay for by my company , but i ' d be extremely disappointed if i have pay for it .",0,538
"the gaylord palm ruin our family vacation . we live about 45 min away from this hotel and have spend thousand and thousand of dollar between family trip and business event throw there for our company , since i be a kid . in fact , we be loyal a a business and a a family to marriott hotel because they always get it right . gaylord palm have ruin our experience with marriott and we will never spend another dime there again . here be what happen at the gaylord palm this past weekend : my father sell his company ( a company he ' s own for 20 year ) in october and we want to celebrate , a a family , the official sale of the business in december . we decide to book a weekend in a 3 bedroom suite at the gaylord palm . because we have ton of experience with this hotel , we know it would be extremely busy this time of year and we book well in advance and pay in full in advance- complete with confirmation email and a guarantee of the size of our suite print on our confirmation . on the first day of our trip , we decide to leave our house in the morning and spend the day at universal studio . that afternoon , we all decide to stay in the park through the evening and have dinner at emeril ' s restaurant . around 2pm my father and i call the gaylord palm to let them know our plan and request a late check in , mostly to assure them that we be already in orlando so that they know we be come and didn ' t re- sell our suite to someone else . they assure u that they would never do that and that they have u down for a late- evening arrival . we finish our dinner and head to the gaylord palm around 9pm . upon arrival , we be greet with an enormous line of angry people at the check in desk and a rude , disrespectful concierge , mark adamson , who tell u that our room have be give away and that there be nothing he could do about it because there be `` no guarantee. `` in fact , the entire angry line of people at check in be in the exact same situation a u . pay in full for room booked month in advance and they just re- sell them without a thought that this be atrocious customer service . we have our money refund and drive home , completely disappointed . we pay the upcharge for marriott- level service because we expect marriott- level service . what a joke . we will never again make the mistake of stay at or host an event at a marriott property . this joyous family occasion could not have be more ruined by the gaylord palm and if marriott care anything about their so- call `` value '' customer , they should think long and hard about some serious change that need to be make in the way they conduct their business .",0,536
"this be a toughish one to rate a i feel very torn about my stay at the omni . conveniently locate just off of i- 4 , the resort be in a brand newly develop area very large in scope and grand in structure . we book our stay through and for 4 1/ 2 star i be sorta hop it would actually be closer to my friend in celebration but that ' s what you get when you don ' t control your destination . we arrive on saturday afternoon with no problem find a spot ourselves in self parking a the lot be just outside of the lobby . the hotel be massive yet there be hardly any guest . the staff check u in very politely and make everything very easy . our room have a beautiful view overlook the humungous pool '' s '' lagoon style with slide and cabana a well a the long stretched golf course in the back drop . very luxurious and a gorgeous sight to see , we instantly felt relaxed . we make a visit to their cigar bar where the nicest bartender serve u drink and small chit chat . we play a game of pool , and dart in a darkly furnished room with a plasma tv mount to the wall in front of stadium seat mtv crib style . the bar and living room area lead out to a huge grand staircase that lead down to the larger than life pool with an electric fire pit off to the side with stone . the room be nicely appoint and modern in design . the hotel also have an underground mall type area with a deli , coffee shop & amp ; and a golf gear shop . we do not try the restaurant though the entrance look really cool but we do order breakfast room service and it be great and the oj really fresh and delicious . this hotel be [ i ' m sorry to stereotype ] perfect for the golfer or mature couple who be look to relax , play golf , hang by the pool , go to the cigar bar and have light out at 11pm . since i wouldn ' t say we be any of that , especially the fall asleep at 11pm part , have their bar shut at 11pm , the pool close with the gate shut at 10pm include the jacuzzi , and no bar or any other option in close distance , we be leave to our own device . we saw some child here but if i be a child in disney world , i would probably want something a little more geared toward disney . my husband and i will probably not be back only because we like to go in the pool after dinner and when a hotel be that militant about you not have access to their pool ( all rule be make to be bent ) , it be like look at ' it ' s a small world ' a a kid from a balcony that you can ' t get down from to enjoy .",0,536

"we stay here to receive the express unlimited ride access pas . that be the main reason we pick this hotel . well it be between one of the three that offer the unlimited express pas . personally i would rather stay at hard rock next time , it be more up beat , but more on that later . we choose this one because it be a king bed and the hard rock be a queen bed for same price , that and also the room size of the portofino be bigger . those be the initial reason for pick the hotel . when we arrive the valet say they have to take our bag , we say we could manage but they insist . a it turn out i ' m glad they take them a it be quite a long walk and two elevator to get to our room . however , be force to check bag ? ? when we be check in the woman be very nice and polite , the gentleman stand next to hear didn ' t seem the same . he have this smug look like we don ' t belong here . we be wear tank top at the time , and i know it ' s a fancy resort , but still it ' s july and 100 degree outside and we ' re on vacation . after awhile i come back downstairs to ask if they have laundry on property , and it be the same man a earlier . he say `` you mean like self serve ? `` the way he say it be rude , like you mean you don ' t have servant . . . he do go on to tell me that the hard rock do have a self service laundry . after all of this process the rest of the stay be enjoyable . we stay 3 night , but didn ' t really get much of a chance to check out the resort too much a we have to visit family and go to the park . we do go to the main pool and be a kid at hurt the water slide be actually pretty cool at the pool . they be play harry potter a the movie under the star too . unfortunately we didn ' t get to try the food at the restaurant a we be at the city walk most of the time , plus the restaurant close too early for u , a we be at the park late . the room be nice , but a someone previously mention for a ridiculously high price room the room should be impeccable . it be not to say the least . the bed however , be extremely comfortable . all in all it be a decent visit , but a state earlier i would have prefer hard rock . it be more up beat , younger crowd music play all over . portofino we be expect more romance and be not overly impressed with that aspect at all . the property be very gorgeous though .",0,530
"first , this be not on disney property ! ! ! i think i be stay on disney property but when i reach there , they be not on disney property ! ! but very close to epot and hollywood studio . i have stay there for 10 day in chrismas and new year holiday . i have definetely experience better consider it a 4 star hotel . the price we pay for the holiday be more than $ 310 a night and the room be not worth it at all . first , it close to disney with boat and bus go to the disney park which be a huge plus and probably the only reason we stay there . we reach there early and they check u in 3 hour before their check- in time so thats what the 2 star for . i really want my review to help people in know what to expect when they reach there after driving/ fly thousand of mile . 2 bottle of water , free internet , some free phone call , and complementary sweet basket from the hotel staff be include in the price . first the room - not so good , old , not so clean , we stay in 14th floor and there be some nasty smell in that floor that i still couldnt figure out . also , slow internet . . . . no laundry room in the floor , the only one i could find be on the 1st floor with the game and fitness room . house keep - they be not really interested in clean room at all . i leave my room in the morning and when come back , the only change be , new towel , new bottle of water , new bed sheet and trash pick- up . my bath be not clean , room be not vacumed at all . all 10 day , they didnt clean my wash room ! ! ! room service - i order dinner from the room service multiple time just because we be tire after a long disney day and didnt want to go out to eat something good . the food be average but very expensive . after i be do with my dinner , i leave my cart outside my room and it be there for 2 day until i call them and remided them to pick it up . people even put their trash on the cart and make it look like trash can right infront of my room which be disgust ! ! ! all restaruants in the hotel be very expensive and be not worth the price you pay . they charge you $ 15 for park per night , $ 15 for swan boat ride , $ 4 per laundry load ( wash and dry ) . next time , i be in disney , i ' ll stay in some 5 star hotel around buena vista dr which be almost a close to disney a swan and dolphin resort but much cheaper with shuttle service to all disney park .",0,527
"stay in rm 304 and play el campeon the first day . play la colinas today , but want to get this review do while memory be still fresh . staff , generally speak have be very good . mostly very friendly and helpful . el campeon , allegedly the `` harder '' and `` better '' of the two , be mediocre . fairway be way over water in large area , result in unplayable swamp . tee box marker be throw aside for the lady tee , so my partner have to guess her tee off spot . the starter explain nothing about the course , not even the pin position . the bag boy , in the middle of a conversation with u , take a phone call from his brother and turn his back on u without so much a an excuse me . finally , our tee time be 0836. we saw absolutely no other golfer until hole # 12. by hole # 13 we be wait on pretty much every shot due to back up play three group ahead . that group have start at 0715 accord to the beverage cart driver . so , i call the clubhouse , or at least tried two . no one answer for about fifteen ring when the switchboard operator pick back up and try again . get through that time after about ten ring . we be on # 14 tee box at this point . the man who answer the phone , finally , in the clubhouse say they ' d send someone out to check on thing . they never do . when we finally slog in after take two hour for the la six hole the man behind the counter in the clubhouse deny they ' d ever get a phone call and suggest we must ' ve call the wrong number . the room be okay , except the wall be so thin you can here a sneeze in the next room and the door be so poorly seal it have a corona of light around it at night from the hallway light . on top of that the front desk put u in amongst a group of very poorly chaperon teenager . they start open and closing door about 0430. at 0515 one of them mistakenly phone our room . by 0545 it sound like recess in the hallway . finally , the restaurants/ bar . the food be good , except for a very nasty dish of cheese whiz laden potato skin at nicker ' s. stay away . management have try hard to update the place , it seem , but everything from a 1985 tv in the men ' s lounge to 1970 ' s acoustic ceiling tile scream outdated . and don ' t even think about a seat at the one bar in la margarita- - there ' s all , of sic tightly pack chair . one nice modern touch be an effective and widely available free wireless internet connection . we win ' t be come back .",0,524
"living in this general neighborhood , i ' ve eat here a number of time , lunch and dinner . i must say i ' ve never have a bad meal here . the service be always unostentatious and good , and the food really decent . our most recent meal be on valentine ' s day . interesting situation at the reception . my wife and i arrive just after a couple ahead of u . they ask if we have a reservation ( we do ) and seat u first . but when they seat the two ahead of u , they get a booth - clearly a better table . the only way i could rationalize be that the booth be set up for four , and take u there would make it look like they be unprepared for u . but they could easily get around that by take u to the booth , say they have the other table ready , but that they be give u the better table . yeah - trust me to be anal about something a `` mundane '' a seating in a dining room . they have a special menu which be really good value : 4- course feature filet and lobster tail for $ 45. filet be kind of skinny ( 4 oz . maybe ) but the lobster look decent . in any case , we opt to order a la carte , since my wife have her eye on the wild scallop . i can ' t tell you what i have ( grouper , i think ) , but her scallop , punctuate with out- of- this- world lardons , be outstanding . i didn ' t even begrudge the value of 6 no- very- large scallps . that be worth the price of admission . we want the special feature creme brulee cheese cake for dessert , but waitress anjelica bring a regular cb instead . not very good - taste like it be make with artificial `` cream '' rather than the real thing . i ' m give it 4 star not because it ' s the best restaurant i ' ve ever be to , but to pump up the volume . give them a try . sure beat applebee ' s next door ! p. s. know thy wine when you come here , or to any place for that matter . i ' ve notice that mark- ups be far from uniform . we contemplate either the rosenblum viognier or the buehler chardonnay , both of which be only $ 30 ( the viognier i ' ve see at retail outlet for close to $ 20 , but at least $ 15 , and the buehler just a bit le ) , but then they have the meridian pinot noir at $ 32 , when i ' ve buy it for $ 7 just recently ( regular retail may be around 9 or 10 max ) . in general , wine mark- ups at restaurant of 3x and up be outrageous .",1,523
"i truly appreciate when a company go green . this holiday inn really seem to make an effort and be a member of the florida green lodge program and you can tell- sheet and towel only change on request , few paper material , crappy water pressure ( you take the good and the bad ! ) i be here for two week so i get a pretty thorough overview of the place . my room be much nicer than i initially expect , very clean and modern and an awesome pillow- top king bed . there be bath & amp ; bodywork shampoo , conditioner , and lotion , a well a a fridge , microwave , and cofffee maker in the room . i also have a pull out sofa , a desk and sit chair with plenty of room . it be perfect for my extended stay . the front desk staff be really inconsistent , some of the clerk be great- namely jackie who be always super friendly , others ( okay , just tony ) be for some reason always short with u and pretty condescend . it get to a point when my coworkers and i would wait until he go in the back or leave the desk if we need anything to approach . another one of the girl be nice , but have just move to the area so she be unable to help u whenever we have any question about the area . the breakfast be nice- but my company be pay for it so i don ' t know if i can judge true value- and the server be always friendly even when overwhelm . the bartender be the same lady pretty much every night ( not that we be there all the time or anything . . ) and be very snappy and witty . i like her . the food in the restaurant be typical hotel food , but have some surprisingly nice dishes- try the fruit of the sea , quite tasty despite the odd name . the fried cheesecake be a fan favorite on many a late night a well , and i never say no to sweet potato fry . they offer a complimentary shuttle within 3 mile , but sometimes you feel like you be a huge inconvenience to both the driver and the desk when you try to set up a ride to anywhere except the airport . the hotel have a cool deal with enterprise though- you can pick up a car between 4- 6pm and return in the next morning before 12 noon for half day price . four of u go in on it for a night for $ 34 with taxes- definitely worth it if you want to get out a bit ! all in all it be a nice experience , and somewhere i would definitely consider stay if you need to be near the mco airport- it be a very quick drive , but far enough that it be still quiet without a lot of air traffic noise .",1,522
"my review be base solely on the banquet aspect of the hotel . my company hold it annual breakfast at the hyatt regency this year and it take place in the regency ballroom which be enormous and hold easily over 1 , 000 people . let me say that this hotel be gorgeous on the inside , very luxurious which i expect consider this use to be the peabody . the parking be a hike from these ballroom , a good 10 minute walk . if you decide to self park , you will be pay $ 16 . 00 whether you ' re there for an hour or the whole day . i find that to be too expensive , it should really be base per hour especially for those that be not stay at the hotel . there ' s no parking attendant in the garage , you pay at one of those self pay machine and insert the ticket into the machine at the exit . if you choose to valet , i believe it ' s $ 26 . 00 plus tip which again , seem way too expensive . the ballroom itself be like any other ballroom i ' ve see in my life , just a giant space to accomodate people . i be disappoint with the breakfast they serve u , definitely not up to hyatt ' s standard . the scrambled egg be runny which be definitely a big no no , the bacon be burn to a crisp and the hash brown be very spicy which i ' ve never encounter before . they offer fresh fruit and that be probably the highlight of the breakfast . the service be underwhelming and the server we have be a bit rude and didn ' t offer up a smile . i ask her for a soda and she act like i be ask for the world , yes i get notorious eye roll which i despise . i ' m not sure whether the hyatt employ these people or if they come from some outside agency but regardless , customer service need to be a priority . i walk around the hotel just to look around and i come across the pool area which look very tempting . i saw some waterfall a well a a small water slide along with hundred of chair to relax in . they offer a cafe a well a a small dining area that serve sandwich and dessert . i have no idea what the pricing be but i ' m sure it expensive give everything else be not cheap . since i live in orlando , i will probably never stay here because when i do vacation , i tend to leave the orlando area for more exciting destination . i also try to avoid hotel that charge for parking , i feel it really ridiculous consider they be already charge you a premium with the room rate along with all the other fee they tack on , greed at it finest !",1,518
"we find significant lapse in quality and customer service at the holiday inn orange lake resort . when we arrive at our suite after check- in , the elevator be break . i report the elevator outage to someone in maintenance , who state someone would be out `` within anhour or two. `` i speak to the operator , nina , who fail to connect me with reservation three time . we drive back to the main office ( about 15 minute on the large property ) , and ask to speak to a manager . the manager wasn ' t available , but someone at a reservation desk move u to a different building . we drive another 15 minute back to the new building . when we reach our room on the 4th floor , we discover pile of dirty laundry , trash , and clean equipment in front of and block the door to the suite . after move a pile of laundry aside and move our luggage into our suite , we find the room be not appropriately clean . there be trash , include a bottle of propane , on the back deck , and there be trash left in the main bedroom . i try call management again , but nina ( again ) refuse to connect me directly ; she demand to know what the problem be , then state a manager would be over to clean it up . we wait for over an hour , then leave . when we return at 11pm , the trash , laundry , and clean supply be go from the front door area , but the trash on the back porch have not be clean . the following day , we be wake at 8 : 30am to multiple automated call to attend a timeshare sale pitch . later , we discover we do not have very many towel . i call the operator , and nina ( again ) state that there would be a $ 7 . 50 charge for additional towel . she do note that the suite have a washer/ dryer . i explain that we have already try the dryer , but it be defective . she say she could have someone from maintenance out to investigate , `` within the next 3 days. `` of course , we be leave in 3 day . we be wake every subsequent morning by automated sale call , until i disconnect the phone . needle to say , our stay at this holiday inn resort be abysmal , and overwhelmingly disappointing . we take yearly vacation to the disney park , and pick this location over several of it competitor . this be most certainly not our experience with holiday inn in the past . there be a great disconnect , at this location , between the switchboard operator and an empowered executive - - either due to bureaucracy or to lack of motivation . we ' re certain to not stay at this `` resort '' again .",0,518
"nice , if standard , hotel convenient to universal studio , i- 4 and decent eats within walk distance . first , to those reviewer complain about the walk to universal : oh , stop . it ' s a 10 minute walk to the entrance area . we even find a shortcut - cut- through the car exit on the left side and enter the parking garage through a small gate . you ' re now in the jaw lot . not a big deal . you ' ll be walk for hour anyway . the front desk be pleasant and easy , although we be give card key that didn ' t work . the cookie be a nice touch . the room be very clean , spacious and properly chill ( i be a huge critic of weak ac , especially in summer or anytime in florida ) . the bed be comfortable , the pillow actually pretty good . the tv get hbo an a decent assortment . there be a small fridge and lot of storage . the ice machine be across the hall from u . my wife say , ok here we go - everytime someone get ice the noise will wake u up . well , it wasn ' t people get ice that make a racket . it be the ice be dump from the top machine to the dispense bin below . . . whenever that happen , which seem like once an hour , the sound be unreal . simple solution - i unplug the top unit so it stop make ice . the good news be , there be plenty of ice in the bin for the next 3 day . the bad news . . . i forget to plug it back in when we leave . we be annoy by the cleaning staff - one woman in particular . she knock ( tap ) on our door at 8 : 15am and 8 : 25 be two consecutive morning , ready to clean our room ! the park don ' t even open until 9 and she want u out ? when i tell her we weren ' t leaving , she tell me hang the do not disturb sign so no one else will knock . that ' s a lousy policy . we shouldn ' t need to worry about clean crew that early when we ' re on vacation . a few tip : don ' t get too excite over the 35 shrimp menu item at the ale house next door . they ' re small , flavorless and rubbery . still , not a bad pub if you order right . there ' s a carrabba ' s italian grill a little further down the street - always a good meal . by far our favorite chain around the country . walgreens be a god place to load up on drink and snack for the room . heard bad thing about kobe , the asian place next door .",0,518
"first of all i would like to comment on the positive point of our stay . we stay on the third floor of the 800 building and the room be very spacious and accommodate our family of eight . 900 $ for the week be well worth it since activity such a free paddleboating , outdoor pool , a gym ( which i never get a chance to check out but sure be great ) , outdoor bar by the pool , mini golf , fishing , and a basketball court be available . needle to say , you can pretty much stay in the resort the entire time and still have fun . now for the bad part and trust me , there be more con than there be pro . when we first check into our room , the security be rude . since we take two seperate car , they wouldnt even let u park and wait for the other car to check in . they pretty much tell u , `` if you dont have a suite number we cant let you in '' . and so we have to wait in 98* weather for about an hour since their front desk be slow , rude , and generally dont give a shit about their guest . so ! after about 6 hour , they call u and tell u our room be ready . we drive back , go to the front desk , grab our key , and go to our room where we encounter a bunch of angry housekeep lady tell u , `` what be you do here ? we ' re not ready yet . whatever , just put your stuff out of our way , we ' re still cleaning. `` anyways , the entire stay be pretty much ruin by rude employee with the exception of two ! dilma the giftshop girl be really friendly and we have a nice conversation about how i be go to fall over because i be party too hard . and marin the cameraman who be really friendly and understanding when we be check out know that we be grouchy , hot , and homesick . the ticket center try to sell you on how they have great theme park deal , but you can find cheaper deal at the local gift shop dealer . also keep in mind that they do not have discount single day parkhopper ticket at disneyworld and universal while local vendor do . their giftshop overcharge for spf 30 sunblock when in the florida heat , you can drive down the street and get spf 100 sunblock for 7 buck . and the straw that break the camel back ! be the roll power outage . we do not pay for a room that frequently shut off all electricity and air conditioning . all in all , this place suuuuuuucks ! the only reason i give it 3 star be because of thr two decent employee , and the fun activity for the kid .",1,517
"my parent choose bay lake tower a their home base a vacation club member , and this be our first stay here . walk into my room , i be impressed . full kitchen with microwave , fridge , oven , toaster , etc . we order grocery to have for breakfast and it save a lot of money and hassle . there be a living area that also double a a bedroom with a pull out couch and chair . there be a flat screen tv and an even better view out the huge window . the living area have it own bathroom and shower . the master bedroom be gorgeous . huge bed , flat screen tv , jacuzzi tub/ shower , spacious balcony . there be another bedroom that i stay in that have two queen bed , another balcony , it own bathroom , and another flat screen . ( we have a washer and dryer , which be awesome ! you can come home with a suitcase full of clean clothes ) the decor be modern and fun and the room be very clean . stay at bay lake have many advantage . for one , you could use the pool out back or you could walk to the contemporary and use their pool . both have hot tub and slide and a kid area . there be also a marina onsite , which allow you to rent boat , wave runner , and even parasail . this be a lot of fun . there be a bridge connecting to the contemporary on the 5th floor , meaning we could easily be over there to enjoy the restaurant , the shop , or get on the monorail ( this also mean there will be no bus to take you to magic kingdom or epcot ) . the hotel be in walk distance of magic kingdom , and i do the walk numerous time . speaking of magic kingdom , if you go out on any balcony at bay lake tower and you can see the castle and the fire work show . tune your tv to channel 20 and they play the music from the show , so it ' s like you be in magic kingdom watching , except you dont have to deal with the annoy crowd . top of the world be the sky lounge at bay lake . you have to ask at the front desk to go up , but any age be welcome and you can enjoy the bar ( and virgin drink for the kid ) and watch the firework from the highest view . one annoyance be that you have to check in at the contemporary and bay lake doesn ' t have much of a lobby/ front desk area . check in also take about half an hour . overall i have a great stay . my room be spacious and luxurious , yet kid friendly . i usually hate stay at hotel , but they make it feel like home .",1,516
"my first impression be `` wow , this be really big. `` the room be arrange around a central plaza , off of which extend everything - front desk , restaurant , ballroom , and shopping . my second impression be that the front desk be really hard to find . i didn ' t come in the front door , which would have help . still , have to ask a staff member to point me in the right direction put me off from the beginning . then , when i find what i thought be the front desk , it turn out it wasn ' t. it be something call quick queue . i haven ' t look it up to see what that be for . if your room be not face sea world , then it ' s on the opposite side of the lobby from the front desk . it ' s a pretty good hike to get to the right elevator bank . if you ' re on the sea world side , the elevator be right behind you at the front desk . the room be okay , just standard hotel room . there be adequate soundproofing between room , at least around ours , but the door slam along the hallway be very audible . and all the door slam when they close , unless you close them yourself . cleanliness : i do my usual check for bedbug and find none . sheet be clean , and the mattress also seem clean . bathroom be clean : shower , sink , and toilet . the towel be spotless . the toilet lid be off center . there be no visible stain on the chair or carpet . one stain that look like green ink on one of the bed runner . tv , refrigerator , clock , alarm , telephone , and coffee maker all work . climate control be smooth and kept thing comfortable without lot of noise or excessive air blow . there ' s a laundry facility that be pretty busy when i walk by it . starbuck ' s be in the lobby , a be a creamery that make ice cream sundae , milkshake , cone , etc . we eat at the sport bar in the lobby . food be overprice and probably all frozen . my blackened chicken sandwich be okay - the spicy mayo have a bitter herb that clash with the spice of the chicken . the fry be limp and bland . pretty disappoint for $ 14. service be slow , probably because they have to hike the food across that vast lobby , but our waiter be friendly . aside from a flashy lobby and have maximum convenience to sea world , there ' s not much special about this place except the great customer service . about the best part of this hotel be the staff i encounter . all of them be cheerful , friendly , professional , courteous , and helpful .",0,515
"let me start off by make this statement . the two star rating be compare this disney resort with the other resort on the wdw property . i have stay at the dvc villa at the wilderness lodge ( 2x ) , the polynesian , saratoga spring ( 2x ) , port orleans french quarter and old key west . this be a very nice place to stay but i would much rather stay at one of the other wdw resort . to start off the room be very small compare to the other disney resort . i have stay in moderate resort ( port orleans ) that have a bigger room than bay lake tower studio accommodation . it be very tight for 4 people to stay in the room . when i stay here i spend the first half of my stay at bay lake and the second half at saratoga spring . i be so happy to check into saratoga spring and be able to spread out and relax . at bay lake there be a security gate at pool so you have to use your key to access the pool and you need security to let you access the observation deck . i guess i can understand the security at the observation deck but at the pool ? this be the only resort that require you to use your room key to access the pool . the only perk for stay at this resort be access to the monorail . however because you be the first stop after the mk you have to board the monorail and make three stop before you get to the mk . if you be head to epcot you need to make the transfer at the transportation center . so it not that much of a perk . if you stay at the wilderness lodge you have an express boat ride to the mk that be exclusive to the wilderness lodge guest . a for watch the firework from the bay lake observation deck , you be better off go to the mk and ask the cast member of the astro- orbiter to let you up watch the firework from there . my 8 year old have a difficult time watch the firework from the observation deck because the railing be too high . i have some issue with the cast member at the contemporary but nothing extraordinary that i would get into detail in this review but i know would never happen at another wdw resort . maybe if i take a trip without the kid and be able to reserve one bedroom accommodation i would consider bay lake tower but for now i would prefer to stay at wilderness lodge and lay on the beach and watch the light parade on the water or play 18 hole at saratoga spring . if you be not a dvc member and would like to know more just send me message and i can let you in on disney ' s best kept secret .",0,513
"you know those piece of paper you fill out at spa where you say problem area , allergy , place you don ' t want them to massage , etc . . . ? those be some great piece of paper because they actually the the massage therapist what you want and don ' t want . i be fill mine out , and the massage therapist , michael , come in and tell me that i didn ' t need to fill that out , that `` we can just talk. `` which at first , i think , cool ! we can just discuss it . but then when we get to the room , he just tell me where to put my stuff and that he would be back . ummm . . . okay ? so , i get undressed and under the towel ( yes , folk , no blanket at eo inn , just a towel to go over your body . uh , what ? ) he come back in , ask if i have problem area , and i say , yes , back and leg . then he start to massage . uhhh . . . that ' s it ? that ' s our `` we can just talk '' ? hmm . anyway , the entire first half of the massage be fluff . my grandma could have give me a better massage . when he get to the leg he be go way too high up and involve in my butt and it make me so uncomfortable . ( again , something that nice piece of paper would have tell him just fine. ) so , i have to ask him to stop , and i could just feel him have an attitude about it . when he tell me it be time to turn over , i ask him if i could just stay a be and have him work on my shoulder more because seriously , this be a deep tissue massage and i feel like i just get a back rub . again , could feel the attitude about it and it just make the entire experience uncomfortable . anyway , so he continue with massage my shoulder and i will say there be a little more pressure this time around . i could feel his hand tremble with how much pressure he think he be put onto my back , but it be not enough and i ' m pretty sure it wouldn ' t be at anyone ' s expectation for a deep tissue massage . it would take more effort to open a door than what he be give me . needle to say , i ' m very unhappy with my massage , it ' s probably one of the worst massage i ' ve have and it ' s certainly not worth $ 80 ( or even the yelp deal they ' re offer right now ) . so annoyed and disappointed .",0,513

"do not stay here ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this place be horrible . these guy deserve no star , i have have the most uncomfortable stay that i have ever have in my entire life and i travel quite often . firstly when they say they have wifi they be lie it only work when you stand at the front by the reception area this be incredibly frustrate consider we come here for that reason a we be international traveller and we want to contact our family . our first night we be wake up to a strong smell of weed it be about midnight , in the morning again all we could smell be weed and consider we be in smoke free room we politely tell the office in the morning that the people next to u be smoke weed so that they wouldn ' t think it be u , that afternoon we get tell they have kick the man out and that we could move room if we want to so we do . we be out right on the other side of the hotel where we couldn ' t find the internet connection at all and our bathroom light wouldn ' t work , we be tell someone would come and fix it but we wait all afternoon and no one come so we have to shower in the dark . the next day we tell the front desk and ask if possibly we could move closer we get tell we have to wait in our room for an hour and they would call u so we do we wait for about 3 hour and no one call so we go back over , stand at the front desk wait and they start talk to each other in spanish right in front of u know we wouldn ' t understand this be the most rudest thing i could tell they be talk about u ! we have have enough if we have spare money to find somewhere else we would of be out of there . finally they have a room for u which we move into only to find out later that night the air condition didn ' t work at all so for our last 3 night there be no way we be go to waste our time get move again consider the way we be treat so we just have to deal with it we just have the worst sleep ever and there be roach in the bathroom we leave them under plastic cup for them to see ! we couldn ' t wait to leave ! there ' s a sign out the front that say 100 % smoke free property but there ' s people smoke everywhere it ' s disgust i have stay in some cheap and nasty accomodation while travel this have be the absolute worst .",0,499
"i ' m usually not a fan of resort , but i must say my stay here blow me away . well , it disney , if they didn ' t do a great job , than what ' s the point ? my stay here be two- fold , i be attend a friend ' s disney wedding and take a mini adult vacation . because of the wedding , my friend and i be able to get our room at a discount price which help considerably . however , for the amount you spend ( even normally ) be totally worth everything you get . since my friend and i be adult with zero little thing , we be thrill to see how isolated each section of the resort be , not to mention how generally well- behave the kid be . no scream child all hour of the night , and no scream parent at all hour of the day . the accomindations in the room be pretty basic , with a hint of a finding nemo theme and the occasional hidden mickey . i definitely appericated the divide current between the sink/ bathroom area and the rest of the room . my one complaint be for four people ( read : adult ) , there wasn ' t enough storage space for everyone ' s clothes and suitcase . we be kinda trip all over each other ' s bag by the second day . the restore accomindaitons more than make up for everything . the whole place be divide into different section name after caribbean island , and each section have their own little plaza area complete with a small pool and a few chair . the main common area offer a semi- decent selection of food place albeit a tad expensive , and of course the obligatory gift shop . the main pool have a great caribbean pirate theme . i love the fact that they leave the pool open all night long , but no life guard after a certain time . even the outdoor cabana bar be a nice touch for the adult . my biggest complaint be the park bus service . i like the idea that the bus go to each section of the restore for pick up and drop off , however the wait time be ridiculous . my friend and i be stick at magic kingdom for well over an hour and half wait for a bus to take u back to the resort . unfortunately , that be not an isolated incident , but be the longest time spend wait to be pick up from both the resort and the various park . great in theory , terrible in practice . if i be able to get a room at the discounted price again and the bus issue resolve , i would definitely come back for another adult vacation at this resort .",1,496
"be aware of the photo package they be and continue to be a nightmare experience for our family . my wife convince me to get this package where they take all the photo and we don ' t have to take any , i think it would be a great idea since we never get photo of all 4 of u together since one of u always have to take the picture . we spend about an hour each day at each park we enter try to get the ride feature add to our package that we be tell be already include . no one know what the deal be , then they finally come to the conclusion that it be not include and we have to add it . . . they want to charge u an additional $ 89 , when my wife point out that if you buy it at the ride instead of at the entrance of each park at the official photo pas place it be only $ 49 , , they say yeah it mess up , but you have to buy it there ( wait in more line ) for $ 49 , if you want to buy it here it $ 89. . the worst part be half the photo we have take be miss and do not show up , my wife have to sit with someone for 2 night after the park for about an hour each night go thru thousand of photo to find our shot . . but all of our shot from the not so scary halloween which be the reason we come down this time of year be miss , so we have no shot of our family in costume . the worst part be it would have be so easy for u to snap a few shot , but we think , nah , , we pay the money why not just have the pro ' s take the shot , so we have no photo from that night . . . besides that absolute nightmare , this be the first time we stay for a long period ( 8 night 7 day ) of time at disney and at a premium resort ( animal kingdom lodge ) the park be awesome , and the lodge be amaze . . staff be good , but not a disnyfied a i remember . . especially any and almost all of the photo help we encounter , , , not the actual photographer but the people who we look to for help just do not seem to have any answer and each of them have different one . . all tell we spend about 8 or so total hour deal with photo garbage while we be there and we continue to spend time now hop they will at least find one photo of our family together in costume via email . .",0,495

"ok so far not to bad on our first return trip . checkin be not the best . we arrive after dark and the valet dress in black be stand in the dark try to direct u . hummm this doesn ' t make the best sense in my opinion but finally get to the circle so my wife can go check in to the hotel . we always self park . my experience at this hotel say the parking be $ 16 for self parking and the lot be usually got ample parking and all though it a hike i would always prefer to park my own car . here be the catch though . the hotel have change key card to more modern secure card but on arrival to the self parking . . . . . . . . no way in except to take a ticket ? ? they didn ' t say anything at check- in about park so this be a surprise . we take a ticket and immediately proceed to the exit go back to the circle to get a parking lot key without have to pay with ticket on exit . back at check in they state oh you just take a ticket each time and let them know on the way out that you be an overnight guest and your room number . hummm that would have be helpful information at check- in ! ! ! so we proceed back to the parking lot . . . . the next issue be they have all the relatively close parking block off so that you can ' t park there and instead send you out to the middle of absolute no whereville . ugh glad leave the kid and wife at the check- in this time . i sure hope that they don ' t charge $ 16 a night for this parking . each time i ' ve be here i think the parking be a bit steep but it be everywhere in orlando , but this be a tad rediculous consider they have plenty of park but have it block off ( the place we always park on other trip to this property ) . ok so we make it to the room . it actually quite clean this time . ( no glass , the dust present on last visit under the sink be not present ) . quite an improvement this time . the room be spacious . nice new tv ' s. the new state of the art lock be nice once you get the hang of them . there be an in room safe , a refrigerator and a always nice decor ! it time for bed now and off to the park first thing in the morning . will update this review at check- out to let you know how the rest of the stay go .",1,492
"have stay at gaylord property before , i know in advance that the place would be grand . it live up to my expectation for sure - from a hotel stand point i would not hesitate to give it a 5 star if i be simply rating the cleanliness and the room and pleasant staff . however here be my issue that you may want to note . stair . where be they if you want to take stair instead of elevator ? good question that not one staff person could answer . after ask the first time and have a staff person say we don ' t have any - i know that couldn ' t be the case so it kind of become my mission to find them - a do it become the mission of other conference attendee that stay 12 day along with me . i personally asked 8 people and most say i think we have some just don ' t know where . this have to be a fire hazard for sure . second issue happen on day 2 of our 12 day stay . the entire property lose water . every single inch of this huge resort and convention center lose running water . so after my workout and before my meeting start - i learn this . it last 10 hour . stuff happen and it wasn ' t their fault for sure however my concern be that they didn ' t have a contingency plan for this . the restroom - people go but they didn ' t flush . no water mean no wash hand so the first thing they should have do be put hand sanitizer in every restroom . they didn ' t until a few hour past and i go to the management to ask if they be prepare for the potential risk they where take let this happen . i don ' t blame any of the local staff - the minute you bring it to their attention they jump . the staff be 5 star in my book ! the gym be stellar . great equipment and nice size . only concern be that of 9 kaiser bike they have only one have work screen . most also have strip seat adjustment so you have to keep it where it be . we do notify them and they say they would take care of it but it didn ' t happen while we be there . finally the food . average be about a good a i can give . stay 12 day we have opportunity to try everything- most more than once and it just wasn ' t great . so overall 3 star for this gaylord . i would raise it if they would post where their stair where . be on the top floor without knowledge of a fire exit be scary .",1,491
"i come here with some high expectation because i mean , really , it ' s the almighty gaylord palm ! i ' ll have to start off by say we have a free stay but i ' m go to try to write this review with the `` would i pay for this again '' kind of attitude . so , i will start off with the room . both my boyfriend and i have bad reaction , allergy wise , to their sheet . i understand this kind of stuff can happen but it be kind of awful have really itchy eye and sneeze a lot in a hotel room . the bed be not that comfortable but needle to say , we toughed it out . we do get rather unlucky with our neighbor for 2/ 3 night we be there . so extremely loud at crazy hour of the night . anyways , the pool . they be pretty great . there be a `` kid '' pool and an `` adult '' pool . perfect . kid be cool but not when i ' m on vacation . so , we hang out at the adult pool for the majority of our stay . they have a wait staff around the pool non stop bring food and drink for whomever want it . i will say that while it be very expensive , everything be really good . we have the watermelon/ cucumber cocktail which be to die for and i would of have a many a i could if they hadn ' t be $ 14 each . yikes . we also order food both day we be out there , the quesadilla and bbq chicken flatbread be so good . the bbq chicken have incredible flavor ( kinda messy though ) . we also have the pesto flatbread which i wouldn ' t order again but definitely enjoy everything else . we also have the pleasure of go to the breakfast buffet each morning and it be great . so much stuff to eat ! pancake , waffle ( get these and get a lot of them ) , french toast , ton of fresh fruit , an omelet station to your ordering , pastry , biscuit , etc . i don ' t think i would pay the $ 25/ person have we not have it free but there be another little coffee shop place at the hotel that i think would have be just a good . lastly , a a showcase of their great customer service , our car battery die one night and we have two employee , jimmy and austin , help u out within 5 minute ! awesome . overall , our stay be pretty good but i ' m not sure it be a good a the price like to make it out to be .",0,490

"i accompany my husband to orlando for cisco live . we choose the peabody due to it close proximity to the convention center ( the most convenient location ) and stay here from a sat to a fri. we arrive extremely early on saturday and luckily they have an available room for u . i wasn ' t a fan of the smaller room ( and i ' d be the one hang out in it the most ) so we upgrade a notch and get a larger room in the mallard tower . it be very spacious with a separate seating area and a vanity for me ! yes , the mallard tower be the older building , but when we look to switch to the newer tower due to our a/ c not work so well , i didn ' t like the size/ layout of the room . we decide our current room be better . we have another minor glitch in that our fridge be not work , but that be fix by give u another work fridge in the room . should i need to return to orlando to be near the convention center , i would stay here again . the convenience factor be huge , but the service be what sell me . it be impeccable . every single person be incredibly accommodate and nice ! really make our hotel stay and minor blip easy to get over . although i wish the room have coffee maker . another plus be those like me who do not have child . luckily , there be two pool . the grotto pool be the huge one w/ the waterfall close to the parking structure . the quieter lap pool be also large and cater more towards adult . i love this area . while the husband be in his class , i be relax by the pool . more hotel need two pool area like the peabody . i also get to check out the lovely fitness center ( didn ' t use it ) , and use the spa twice . wish the spa be larger with a hot sauna a well a the steam sauna . peabody also have a few restaurant . i recommend napa for lunch and dinner . b- line grill be gross and capriccio not very good either . i also recommend self- park . i ' m normally a valet girl b/ c i ' m lazy , but every time we valet , it be back up and take forever for our car to come out . the parking structure be conveniently locate a short walk from the hotel . it be faster and a bit cheaper to park this way .",1,465
"i have be talk to my friend ( who be a hard core disney fan ) and he convince me to meet him in orlando and spend a few day at disney world . a i be search for accommodation i come across a great deal at the lake buena vista resort village and spa and book a 2 bedroom . arrival : we arrive , check in and learn they ' ve put u in the newest ( 1 . 5 year old ) of the three building , sweet ! checking in be easy and not a very long wait a there be one group ahead of u . however it become apparent during our stay they be understaffed , not that we have any problem . the room : i book a 2 bed/ 2 bath and we be both pretty happy with it . it be like a little 2 bedroom condo ! though , while it be nice and new , the whole ( room , unit , apartment , condo ) be starkly decorate , lacked personality and warmth , be almost a bit `` sterile '' . the kitchen be nice , but again , minimally equip . nice due to granite counter top , stainless steel fridge , dishwasher and range . minimal due to only have the minium basic to cook and serve up to 4. have a kitchen be nice a we have breakfast each day and cook dinner 2 of the 3 night we be there . another nicety be the stack washer & amp ; dryer ! the large master bedroom have a large bathroom with a large shower and a jacuzzi tub . very nice indeed ! bedroom & amp ; bathroom # 2 be smaller and seperate , but still a decent size and very comfortable . while i do go walk around the kewl pool area ( with pirate ship ! ) to check it out , neither of u use it . a couple time i sit in the nice lounge area off the lobby to take advantage of the free wi- fi . departure : here be where be understaffed really shine through . it take a little longer to check out then expect , mostly because there be others both check in and check out . one of the in ' s or out ' s have some issue which delay thing further . overall : i like the property , the room and the price ! oh yeah , the price . it be a paid- in- full- in- advance , thru the internet only , limited time deal , which net a $ 101 per night rate ! good enough for me !",1,463
"first , i will say i ' m probably not the type of guest place like this be build for and i be not here on a leisure trip . i be in a studio for four night and i do have some work i need to get do my first day there , again not what this place be design for . there isn ' t really anyplace to sit and get something do other than a small round table . i ' m not even sure how a small family would manage to eat at it and there be only two chair . the rest of the room be nicely furnish with a small fridge and microwave . the wifi around the resort work well just about everywhere and be fast . the location , maybe because it be a little isolated , have terrible cell reception . i would have to go out of my unit to get two bar signal with at & amp ; t. there isn ' t any room service at the resort other than pizza delivery in the evening . i have to walk all the way to the pool bar in the main building to order and haul it back to my room . when i mention this to one of the staff , they mention a few restaurant in the area deliver , but couldn ' t provide me any more info . it would be nice if marriott could provide this info , but i ' m sure they prefer you eat in one of their restaurant or buy something from their market . it ' s a huge complex and there be plenty of activity to keep parent and kid occupy . at other marriott vacation property they usually place a schedule for the following day in your room . here i have to go to the concierge desk in the main building , which usually involve multiple offer to book me an activity . fortunately , we have an early morning departure or their 10am checkout policy would have be a pain . i ' m not sure how a family with small kid would get everyone move and out by 10. i have one more gripe with marriott vacation property a a whole and once again i realize i ' m not an owner or their target market . i ' m a long time marriott reward platinum member and other than my bonus point at check in , it doesn ' t seem to buy me anything special at their resort . which be why unless someone else have pick the location already i ' ll usually choose to stay at another marriott property or somewhere else .",0,463
"on arrival , oddly enough , it wasn ' t clear where the check- in counter be . to my left be two small counter , but everything be deck in nfl advertising . the gentleman be wear football jersey , & amp ; there be a sign up say join them for monday night football . ( it be a friday , but after be on holiday i couldn ' t remember what day of the week it be , at the time. ) there be just so much football paraphernalia , that i think maybe there be a special event go on or something . i keep look for another counter , but couldn ' t find something that fit the bill . the staff member seem unnecessarily preoccupy , & amp ; i be the only customer present . i have to interrupt them & amp ; ask if this be the check- in counter . it be just a weird `` welcome. `` the check- in process be speedy . they have everything on file after i have book the room through travelocity . they have a cute little cubby where you could purchase snack & amp ; beverage , complete with a microwave . their bistro be close by the time i arrive around 6pm or so , but fyi it serve starbucks brew coffee . they have a large touch screen in the lobby display the weather & amp ; news headline . the room be spotless . they have complimentary wifi . i request a wake- up call , which come on time . they even phone about an hour later to make sure i have receive my call . the feather bed & amp ; feather pillow be delightful ! ! i only miss the feather duvet , but with orlando ' s temperature compare to alberta , canada ' s temperature it ' s understandable why they would offer something lighter . my room have a sliding door that open out to the pool courtyard . the airport shuttle be efficient . it travel every half hour on the top & amp ; bottom of the hour . they say you don ' t need to reserve space on the shuttle , but i would be sure to do just that . i didn ' t , & amp ; nearly didn ' t get a seat on the shuttle . there be too many of u that need to get to the airport at 5 : 30am . overall , my only complaint be the unclear check- in counter , & amp ; the staff be somewhat preoccupied each of the 3 time i come to them for assistance .",1,460
"first i would like to say if you can give this place no star or negative star , i would give this place just that . this place i give a negative 3 star . here ' s why . . . . first night , we get into the room . it be clean and with the proper set of towel and sheet . but . . . . we want to get up a certain time , so we want to set the alarm clock , but the button didn ' t work . we call down to the desk and they bring up another one . that didn ' t work . finally , the last clock radio work ok. second night , we come in and the room be not entirely clean . they make our bed but that be about what they do . they didn ' t give any clean towel , wash clothes , and new soap . in fact , we be out of tissue and clean cup and they didn ' t replace . so i call the front desk . they say they would send someone with some those item . they didn ' t. i have to personally go down myself and get set of towel and clean cup . third night , they clean the room during the day , but we still need some cup and a wash cloth . everything else be ok. fourth night , everything be ok except for lot of noise by the pool area and our room be just above . there be people talk on the top of their voice until 2 a. m. they be have a party and they didn ' t care if they talk until the sun come up . we do call the front desk but they never do anything at all about hence the 2 a. m. fifth night , they be out by the pool again , but it wasn ' t a bad , but we never say anything . it quiet down about 10ish . sixth and final night - our room never get any housekeeping at all do that day . no new towel , no wash cloth , no cup , nothing ! i have to call down to the front desk again ! they send someone up and he come up very quickly with fresh towel and stuff that should have be there in the first place . please don ' t go to this hotel ! also , their interior be sooooo outdated ! their tv be all old school tv with shotty cable at best . they don ' t care about their hotel at all !",0,460
"spring break 2016we spent 5 night at the cabana bay . our experience be absolutely wonderful . there be 3 adult and 1 teen in our party , we have a larger room on the 7th floor - very nice . love the decor and the space . we eat and drink at all the onsite restaurant and bar . all of them have good food for the money . the drink at the bar be quite delicious and reasonably price ( about $ 10 ) . the food at these hotel be way better price than anything at the park . if you be at the bayliner for dinner try the churasco beef or beef special . make sure you plan a day to use the pool ! love the lazy river , the pool be warm , the spa be hot . plenty of clean towel available in multiple area in the pool region . if you be go to stay in a universal hotel - take advantage of the 1- hour early admittance to universal studio and/ or island of adventure . we go in early for all 3 day and head straight to the wizarding world area . ride the gringotts ride with just a very short wait and then walk right into olivanders with no wait at all . make sure you ride the hogwarts express both direction - different story line each way . the first two day we leave the park at 1 : 00pm to go back to the hotel and rest . one day we attend a movie . we return around 6pm . this meant we be out of the park when traffic and line be at their zenith . because of our strategy , we be able to do it all without express pass . our 3rd day , we be at the park from open to 4pm . we couldn ' t believe the crowd ! wall- to- wall people everywhere . so thankful we skip the huge crowd the first two day . back to the cabana bay : all the staff be friendly and helpful . the universal store inside the lobby have all the best- seller from around the park . much of what we buy in the park could have be purchase there . fyi : if you buy anything in the park , you can have it send to the front gate for pick- up when you leave . my only complaint : the video playing in the bayliner diner wasn ' t that long and on a continual loop . you ' d think they ' d make it longer or change it up . it be cute the first time .",1,460

"disappoint on many level . upon arrival , the hotel be clean . we have be in the car for quite some time , it would have be fantastic have there be some water or refreshment upon arrival . consider it be june and it ' s only 100 degree outside . . . i be inform there ' s a water fountain somewhere by a young woman who look to be in her late teen . for $ 800 per night ( i have 2 room ) i didn ' t want to drink from a water fountain . . . it be irritate when we return around 3 pm in 100 degree weather from the park to cool off there still wasn ' t anywhere to get some cold water . maybe they forget that their patron ' s stay there to visit the park and they walk in the excessively hot weather ? first impression be pitiful over something so simple . pro ' s . . . well the only thing i can tell you be that when you stay in the hotel you can get a water taxi ride to and from the hotel along with an early `` express '' pas which can be purchase at the park a well . it ' s an added value if you ' re willing to pay to stay here . con ' s. . . plumbing in the room ( i have 2 ) both be very loud with gurgle noise throughout the night . you can constantly hear people walk through the hallway . the room be not quiet , we could hear a child in the room across the hall bounce a ball on the tile which sound like it be inside our room . i could hear the tv in the room above a well a the room adjacent . terribly awful to spend that much money for room which you would at least expect to be quiet . the shower be well . . . imagine a 3 foot cubicle all in glass , be careful if you be at least 6 foot tall because it ' s very tight quarter . i felt like i be shower inside a mobile home or efficiency . overall , i be terribly disappointed and consider that i could just purchase the express pass from the park , i see no reason to return to this hotel . the 2 night prior we have a suite ( 1800 square foot ) in the waldorf astoria which run $ 429 per night . i highly recommend stay there and then just get transportation to the park . or quite bluntly , just stay elsewhere .",0,459
"i have stay at several doubletree ' s for business through the year and i be very disappointed in my experience with this one . my first surprise be the outrageous parking cost and hidden tax . parking be $ 17 for self or $ 21 for valet , they never mention the tax until you see it on your bill at checkout , then the individual that check me in make it seem like i be check into the four season with his attitude . all snooty and uppity he hand me the cooky and they be hard and not warm , this be suppose to be their signature . . . i wasn ' t notify at the time of book or checkin that i should sign up for the `` shuttle '' , by the time i get sign up i wouldn ' t get to the park until after 11. this be usually one of the purpose of the customer stay at this location . there should be a shuttle running every 30 minute , that doesn ' t require you to sign up for it . it be a 10- 15 minute walk but when you have little one there be a busier road you have to cross . once i finally get to my room i check my bed because of a previous bed bug post i find on yelp and my bed have old sheet ; there be hair and other item on the sheet when i look at them . the house keep be wonderful and come and change the sheet quickly ; but they change them while i be in the room and that be uncomfortable . this hotel look old and rundown , i have be in older hotel that still maintain the classiness of their lobby level in the room also , not the case this time . it have dirty air return and mold growing in the bathroom . housekeep wake u up at 9 : 30 be tap on the door on the day of checkout to clean my room , i would think i shouldn ' t have to put the shhh sign and they could wait for me to check out on that day . while check out i be surprise by the hidden tax on parking , i say hidden because nowhere be it post that parking be charge a tax . i can not believe that they charge a tax on something like park without notify the customer before hand . i should ' ve have go with the yelp review but i didn ' t believe that a doubletree could be that bad . i be wrong . . .",0,458

"all of the park be amaze ! ! ! a truly magical experience . however , our new experience at the resort didn ' t go a well . i ' ve leave this review with disney corp and on tripadvisor . we vacation 5 night and 6 day at port orleans riverside . this be our first trip to disney world and although i love the resort ground , amenity and staff , the service leave a lot to be desire . we travel often , 2 time a year at least and in the 6 year my husband and i have be together , we have never once have to call and request room service after our room be skip twice . even after have to request the cleaning service , the room be not clean ! the countertop be still sticky , no soap be leave , no cute little towel creature be leave for our kid , the coffee be not replace and there be empty water bottle and styrofoam cup leave on the night stand and counter . the second night we be here , i give my baby a bath and he start scream . i take him out of the towel to find what appear to be a melted button or pin of some sort that have metal intertwine in it . it have scratch my son face . we tool to towel to customer service and make them aware of the incident and be merely ask if he need medical attention . they didn ' t seem too concerned which be scary . but , after that incident , they do have a manager do a cleaning inspection of our room on the 3rd night and surprisingly we have a towel creature , fresh soap and shampoo , coffee , etc . during our stay i also have to put in a service request a the sink in our bathroom be not drain and the front plate on our room door that read our magic band be miss so we could not get into our room . the restaurant on site be great , lunch and dinner quick service be very yummy but breakfast be mediocre at best . the river cruise to downtown be one of my favorite and the carriage rid add a nice touch . the pool be not overcrowd and the ground be kept clean . it be a nice resort but i don ' t think we will be return to this one because of ongoing issue during our stay . after an 18 hour drive with an 8 month old and 5 year old , we just hop to receive better service .",1,457

( like 1am ) the lobby feature a small office center which be really just two computer with a printer . note that the printer only print when use one computer in particular- if memory serf correctly , it ' s the system on the right . and speaking of yelp , if you check- in to the onsite restaurant you will earn a free appetizer . the courteous staff include member of the onsite restaurant who be able to accommodate u a the closing hour approach without any malice , evil look or foul play . we ' ve stay in two class of room : the executive and well , not executive . a expect , the executive have more perk and seem to be newer , possibly remodel . a fridge , higher elevation , two tv and larger space round out the executive room . whereas the standard room bathroom door didn ' t close fully and a fridge be not present . the price difference between the two room be about $ 20 depend on the time of year and whatever promotion may be available . there be a pool and workout room , both of which i have see picture of but never bother to confirm the independent existence of- - it remain a matter of faith . one of the best reason to stay at this radisson be it close proximity to a waffle house . yes , a waffle house that remain open 24 hour a day and be perfect for visit when arrive in orlando at 1am . a golden corral buffet appear to be open up soon in a spot just a bit further past the waffle house , still within easy walk distance . cross alafaya and you ' ll find a denny ' s nearby a well , although give the traffic of alafaya you be probably better off drive . ( you do rent a car , right ? ) we ' ll definitely stay at the radisson again .",0,456
"it ' s hard to judge the caribe royale , because it ' s low by orlando standard , but great by standard in most other place . orlando have resort out the yin- yang . this be one that be not far from all the theme park and convention center , and be target to attendee of either . ( it have a `` disney good neighbor '' certification , whatever that be , and it offer shuttle service to the parks. ) give that , it ' s not the best `` resort. `` i ' m not sure what exactly qualify a hotel a a resort . it do have three separate hotel tower , a large convention center and a large pool with a waterfall and water slide . the room be all suite . i have a full fridge , a living room and a bed room with two queen bed . be it nice ? yes . luxurious ? no . probably a good value for the price , which be le than other `` resorts. `` ( there ' s free parking , but there ' s also a `` resort fee. `` ) the wifi here be horrendous . i have trouble even get my email to load . of course , this be free , and i could always upgrade to a faster connection . . . so this be nothing unique to this property . . . but still annoy . more annoying ? two thing : 1 ) the door to the room have about a 1/ 2- to 3/ 4- inch gap at the bottom . i could see the light from the hall 24/ 7. you can imagine how that work with sound . 2 ) my tub have a leak from the faucet . drip drip drip . i come back one evening to find the tub fill up because the maid have close the drain . i call maintenance and they fix it promptly ( i didn ' t see how . everything be fine , until the next day when i shower again , and there be no way to stop the drip . service be friendly , but the hotel have some serious gap in the actual hotel quality itself . one last flaw that isn ' t anyone ' s fault : the hotel be locate very near a major intersection . during any time of the day where there be traffic , be it beyond nightmarish to try to enter or exit the property . they need a stoplight , because get across six lane of traffic be not an option . be warn .",0,454
"i stay here for 3 night during a conference . there be a couple of positive and a few negative . positive : my flight be actually cancel the night i be suppose to arrive so i call the hotel to see if they could accommodate me the following night and `` readjust '' my reservation . the girl i speak to on the phone say they would keep my reservation but could not refund my first night . i be a little annoyed give it ' s a $ 200/ night charge . i catch the morning flight and get to the hotel at about noon . even though my reservation hadn ' t change from the night before , there be no room ready for me but they would call me when it be ready . so a little annoyed , i go up to my friend ' s room to wait . 15 min later , i get a call say my room be ready and that they would credit the first night for me . so pretty quick to respond , front desk be courteous , clean with free wi- fi through out the hotel . room be a good size , update , and limit cable channel . close to other restaurant , convention center and other hotel . negative : i would have to echo the review about taxi service and transportation to and from the hotel . the hotel doesn ' t provide shuttle service to and from the hotel ( $ 20 one- way ) . the hotel have car wait to take you around town but be wary . one of the car charge 3 people to go 8 mile $ 32 ( flat fee ) . i think it be a bit much for 8 mile and the hotel just kinda shuttle u into the car without a fee posting . last thing , the coffee cart that ' s between the bridge and the convention centre isn ' t open early , despite all the conference . when i go it wasn ' t open before 7am on a saturday and it ' s not open before 7 : 30am on a monday . there ' s a coffee bar in the lobby but , really ? a coffee cart not open before the start of a conference ? overall , the save grace for the hotel be the accommodation they make for me after my flight be cancel . even though i have to ask quite a few time for it , it be eventually resolve with no issue . the hotel room be clean and i appreciate the free wi- fi",1,454
"i think this hotel suck . the pillow be make of some sort of lumpy , hard material that make it almost impossible to sleep . i have a crick in my neck for day . the mattress be not much better . my colleague and i grab a taxi to go to dinner one night , and i should have be suspicious when the bellman wave a minivan by u in favor of an black suv that be obviously not a taxi . i have read the review and be aware of the issue they have with this . the driver take a leave out of the parking lot ( even though our restaurant , tu tu tango be to the right ) , and promptly get stick in traffic , and then eventually turn off international drive onto another road . i be seethe , but want to give the driver a chance to be honest when we get to the restaurant , so i pointedly ask him if the road in front of u be international drive ( the same road that both the hotel and the restaurant be on . he say yes , it be , and i ask why he have take a round- a- bout way to get to the restaurant , and he mumble something about bad traffic ( traffic be move swiftly on international drive , which be directly in front of u ) . i sign the receipt without tipping , which i have never do before . the shampoo and conditioner be terrible ( i ' d forgotten mine at the previous hotel ) , and they only put out one bar of soap which be at the sink in a separate room from the shower . there be shower gel in the bathtub , but there should also be a bar of soap . room service take forever , and even though i ask for it in a to go box so that i could take my fruit to the convention center with me , they give it to me on a huge plate that i could not even fit in the small refrigerator in the room . overall i just felt that the guest at this hotel be unimportant to them . i would try not to stay here again in the future , and since i attend a number of convention each year there be bind to be another occasion to choose whether or not to stay there . the ritz be only about $ 50/ night more expensive , and i should have just go with my guy instinct . next time i ' ll know better .",0,453
"we arrive to the hotel wednesday afternoon . we call and ask if we could check in early and they say call back i ' m an hour , maybe . we show up 1 hour before check- in and they accommodate u with two non- adjacent room . we get into the room and one have central air , the other do not . it basically have a window unit that be not thermostatically control - just on and off . the other room with the central air use to be a smoking room and have an awful smell that would not go away . there be a feeling that the room wet just not very clean . when we return from disney for our second night , we discover that the room have hardly be clean . they didn ' t even wipe the table down . we want ice but the machine be break , we have to go to another building just to get some . also the entrance to the room be outside so it have a real motel feel . we decide to check out one of the three advertise pool . one be break , one be crowd , and we find one far away with construction go on nearby so it be quite loud . we think they be work on the roof and that be why only some room be available . the shuttle only pick up and drop off one time so you ' ll arrive after park opening if you ' re go to disney and you ' ll have to go to other hotel in the process . also if you go to animal kingdom it close at 5 so of you don ' t have a hopper you ' ll be wait around for about 4 hour for the shuttle . if you don ' t bing your own computer and want to use there ' s it a minimum of $ 3 fee to use the internet . you ' re also only go to be able to use wifi in the lobby . you ' ll also pay a $ 8 resort fee per day plus tax so be prepare . overall it ' s a good price but you get what you pay for . shabby , smelly , and inconvenient . the pool we do go to be nice so one star for the cool retro pool and one star for the price and they let u in one hour early . this review be from september 2012 i just get around to finally post my review ( think it be submit already ) .",0,452
"if you didn ' t know this be one of universal ' s newest resort , you could be fool by the 50 ' s- 60 ' s retro theme . they do such a great job portray this from the couch , to the uniform the staff have , to the color , and even the shuttle bus that take you back & amp ; forth be retro theme ! i stay with my family ( mom , sister , & amp ; brother ) so the suite be the perfect amount of space for u . it have a living area with a little kitchen ( fridge and micro ) , and a queen size pull out couch . seperated by a sliding partition door be the bathroom , and the two queen bed . it be cool how the bathroom be split up , toilet and door on one side , shower and sick with a door on the other , and in the middle be another sink and large mirror . we stay in the continental buidling and this suite be sweet ! we be a little too busy at the park to vouch for the bowling ally , gym , and other resturant upstairs . . . but we do visit the pool which be open enough where you have room to swim around , and the pool bar call the atomic tonic . they offer 22oz of their signature mixed drink in take- home cup which you could bring back for a refill of only $ 10 , and they double a a souvenier ! the bayliner diner locate downstairs offer a wide varity of food , some more expensive than others . if you play your card right , you can keep a family meal down to $ 20. the side of mac & amp ; cheese ( $ 3 . 99 ) be a whole plate of yummy mac & amp ; cheese , and it even come with a breadstick ! the shuttle service here prove to be the real mvp though . stay here grant you early admission to the park for harry potter world only . the shuttle run every couple minute it seem to get everyone to the park on time . they also run throughout the day , not a frequently , but once the park close at 10pm they be right back to have multiple shuttle run at once . they also run until 2am which come in handy after a night of bar hop out on city walk . overall , my family and i have a wonderful exerience and would recommend this place to anyone !",1,452

"the business relation associate with this hotel be horrible . my family be look for a place to crash near the theme park a day prior to the rest of our party show up . i call to check availability and pricing . they ask me prior to the quote be i eligible for anything that could be a discount , which i state i be military if that count , and the response be yes . the only amenity i ask for be a balcony with chair . the receptionist state no problem , i will be on the first or second floor in reserve room with one left at a rate of $ 74 , which match the research i do online . she take my credit card information and my final bill would be $ 104. sound high for tax but i figure i would handle it when i get the there . i get off the highway one hour later to check- in and the receptionist tell me ( 1 ) i owe $ 123 for the night not $ 104 that be quote ( 2 ) they will put a $ 50 dollar incidental hold on my card ( 3 ) i will be on the 16th or 17th floor without a balcony . so obviously , i be furious . the final breakdown of $ 123 be a follow : $ 74+ tax ( properly quote ) , $ 20 reservation fee ( not quote ) , $ 17 for park ( not quote ) . this hotel should be advertise the full rate to include all require fee . i be fine with the parking after realize i could leave my car there after check out to catch a shuttle to/ from a theme park but still have a problem with it not be advertise . the room : so instead of the 17th floor , i be put on the second floor like promise but with no seating . the seated balcony be on the opposite side of the hotel . to add insult to injury , i find another $ 29 charge on my card after i check out . come to find out they charge me for a stuffed frog that be never in my room assume we take it ! just ridiculous . the only compliment i can give be the quality of the bed and tv however the rest be a nightmare . spend le time look at the false pricing and fancy white ambiance and ensure you ask about all the relevant add- ons in this review .",0,441
"i don ' t give out 5 star easily , especially when it come to a hotel , but rsc exceed all expectation for this picky traveler . this be a large property with at least 3 swimming pool that i count . the whole place only appear to be a couple year old . it appear to cater to convention business traveller ( like u ) and unlike other so call 4 star hotel ( hello disney dolphin ) in orlando , it be mostly adult and there werent 50 million kid run and scream everywhere . rsc be perfectly and centrally locate and only 15 minute from the airport . ( p at the time of this review , the yelp map appear to be wrong and do not show the correct location for this property ) . our room be perfectly clean and well appoint . one of my pet peeve with hotel be air condition and climate control system that never seem to work or cut off at night . orlando in july be hotter than hell ( except more humid ) and sure enough it be too hot to sleep comfortably . unlike other hotel that just make excuse and say it work fine , rsc send an engineer to the room and he replace the entire thermostat and have icicle hang from the ceiling within minute , which bring me to . . . service ! wow . . . from the moment we arrive until check out , we receive close to ritz carlton level service at rsc . while service decline at most resort and hotel , rsc be up there with the 5 star crowd in term of service . speaking of check- out , they even have a bag service , where they check you in for your flight before you leave the hotel and they even schlep your bag to the airport and check your bag for you . all we have to do be walk to the gate and get on the plane . sweet ! ! ! ! if you be take the kid to the park , you will probably be better off stay at one of the disney resort that cater to more activity for family . if you be a business traveller or just look for a more adult or upscale resort , such a ritz or four season ( but without the 5 star price ) , than i would highly recommend rsc . we be already plan another trip to orlando and we wouldn ' t consider stay anywhere else .",1,439

"we be disappoint by a last minute dvc cancellation that force u to find a hotel elsewhere the weekend of the wdw marathon . luckily we come across shs in the marriott village . in my opinion , this place be a steal . it be clean , brightly light , and the staff be awesome . it be free to park , plus they offer hotel shuttle service between the hotel and the disney park . the pool be nice , even though we didn ' t really get to spend too much time in it , it be clean and quiet . the quality of the free continental breakfast be a surprise . not only do you get the standard like bagel , cereal , and pastry , but our hot option be sausage and egg one morning , bacon another , and ton of fruit and yogurt . they even have a waffle machine . so we do what any smart person would do- - grab some more to bring back to the room for later ! awesome move . and free coffee in the lobby be helpful after a long drive . the bed be a decent enough size for two people to sleep on , but since there be three of u , one person just take the pullout couch . also comfortable . we try out the happy hour across the street , which be fun of an awkward `` how many weirdo can be in a hotel this weekend '' sort . no one think twice about our take drink from one hotel and bring them to the other . the hotel really only lose one star because their pool bar wasn ' t open when we be visit . kid . kind of . my only reason for not give it four star be that we constantly have to request extra towels- - three adult woman in a room need more than four towel , especially if they ' re in town run a marathon . i ' d try to save/ reuse my towel for my hair by leave it hang up , but i think the housekeeping staff think it be dirty since it be wet so they take it with them and didn ' t replace it . but aside from that , it be a great place to stay , and from what i understand , a lot cleaner than it be pre- renovation .",1,417

"i stay in the hyatt place for a week with two friend during a universal orlando/ disneyworld trip . we be look for a nice- ish hotel that wasn ' t go to break the bank . and we find it . first , the room be huge . we have plenty of space with three of u in the same room . and the great thing be that the big flat screen tv could swivel and face either the bed area or the sitting area . the vanity area be also big enough with sufficient mirror space for three girl to get ready at once . the bed be comfortable and i sleep like a rock every night . the check- in staff be polite and helpful , which be nice because we be all a little grumpy from hunger and the fact that we have be on a red- eye flight all night . the hotel have free breakfast , which be always a plus . the breakfast itself be just a standard continental breakfast which be never really anything to write home about , but it be free so i wasn ' t complaining . the parking and wi- fi be also free , which be nice for a hotel so close to a major tourist attraction . the hotel also have a free shuttle service that go to universal orlando and back for hotel guest . but the park be also within walk distance ( probably somewhere around 3/ 4 of a mile ) , so we only use the shuttle our first morning there . the only downside be how slow the elevator be . the hotel itself be probably only 4- 5 story high , but after hit the button , it would take the elevator a couple minute to return to the main floor or whatever floor you be on . some morning , we ' d get to the elevator , one of u would realize we ' d forget our sunglass or something , and we ' d have time to run back to the room and grab whatever it be and make it back before the elevator get there . so a lot of the time , we just take the stair . i would definitely stay in the hyatt place again though . for the price and the location , it just can ' t be beat .",1,409

"pro : breakfast be actually better than what you can expect ; there be some value and i ' ll answer a question that i have when review this hotel prior to my stay . . . . the breakfast be a full buffet spread include a sneeze guard . breakfast get busy at time , but not all the time , typically at the top of the hour . we suggest go early in the morning to beat the screaming , drool , snot handle child . shower in our room be amazing , full blast waterfall experience . bathroom be larger than expect . hotel have nice decor , plenty of parking , the staff be really cool and definitely helpful . hotel be literally smack dab in the middle of a shopping complex . . . kind of ; the hotel be situate in a back section of a grander shopping section ; full of grocery store , liquor store , a variety of restaurant and mini shop , it a perfect location ! con : pool bar be close indefinitely . they do not explain why , just mention that they have no plan to reopen . that really suck , cause um , it ' s all over their website a a featured selling point . room be a expect : a little dank , stinky from humidity . , but give the location and time of year , it ' s to be expect . carpet feel like what you ' d expect from old- weather , use , hotel carpet . some light fixture be le than suspect , sometimes hard to turn on and a sense a if they be go to topple over . room wall be very ' thin. ' if you ' re face the pool , be prepare for as hat to spend the majority of their stay scream into their cell phone and at their friend near the pool . . . you can hear every word . every now and then we would be greet with one of those elite douche who just love talk loud on their phone while simultaneously roam the hall at 3am . i would definitely stay again if package include free breakfast , well worth the money we pay .",1,389
"oh , dear . where do i begin ? i should have take the other review i saw into consideration before book a room at this hotel , but i think that be a good neighbor hotel be enough of a recommendation . it be not . my boyfriend and i check in to the hotel after 6+ hour of drive . after receive the key card - and the seemingly mandatory spiel about the timeshare breakfast the next morning - we go upstairs to find that the room be not ready . we be tell we could wait downstairs another twenty minute and instead opt to get another room . when we go to this room everything seem fine until i inspect the bathroom and find that a good amount of the finishing on the tub have peel and flake off and be haphazardly cover by some flat beige interior paint . we be too tired to go ask for another room . after dinner we come back to the room and settle in for the night , but be awaken around midnight when we hear someone try to get in our room . the noise stop and we assume someone be drunk and go to the wrong room . then twenty minute later the noise happen again , but this time the door open . my boyfriend go to check the door and saw that one of the hotel employee be let someone into our room . they have forget to book u into our room . aside from that , everything be fine for the rest of our stay . the arcade be a rip off . half of the game don ' t work and you have to pay for token to play the game , which seem ridiculous to me give that you have to pay a resort fee for a place that be hardly of resort quality . usually , i would not have write a review . all of these issue could have easily be resolve with good customer service , which we do not receive . whenever we ask any question or need assistance from the hotel staff they act a if we be put them out and then we be face with passive- aggressive attitude and zero eye contact .",0,389
"i just get back from this place and it be phenomenal . the moment you drive through the gate of town you already feel like your somewhere else . i usually just stay at a regular hotel like the fairmont , hilton , renaissance and this place have get to be one of the best . the ambiance be a perfect view with the florida setting . it ' s just a calming experience since nothing be around this resort . the location be just right from disney since it ' s only between 10- 20 minute away which i find be the average drive to everything . grant it ' s a higher end hotel with a ton of amenity . they have a lazy river , sand volleyball pit , tennis court , 2 pool , 2 jacuzzi , a few restaurant and of course a full golf course design by greg norman . a few other perk be the fire pit , and private cabana by the main pool . the room be excellent . very comfortable bed . i have the privilege to stay at one of the villa which have a full kitchen . the kitchen be gorgeous with stainless steel appliance , granite counter top and actual good quality cookware . there be also an lcd flat screen in the main living room with 2 leather lounge chair . this be a 2 bed 2 bath villa they have available and be a pretty good size if your look to accommodate at least 6- 8 people . in the master room there be a corner shower with a jacuzzi tub . both the villa building and main resort building have full blow gym with free weight , treadmill , ellipticals , yoga ball , medicine ball and nice cold water . the staff be extremely friendly at the main resort however , in the club house they be very snooty . if your not their type or over the hill age without a mini skirt you feel like your in a kkk meeting . many of the member or other guest be not very welcome at the clubhouse . luckily i didn ' t come here to play golf . other than the clubhouse experience i would definately come back next year !",1,389
"where do i even begin with this review . let me start of by say that i be a bias reviewer on this subject because i love all thing disney ! ! ! ! ! at this point they can sell me a rock from my own back yard and i just might buy it lol . now thats out- of- the- way let me get into the meaningful review . in my opinion there be two people on this earth . people who love disney and people who hate everything it stand for . obviously i ' m on the lover side . let ' s talk theme park first . there be four theme park and two water park in disney world . each park offer a different experience to it customer . i love all four park but magic kingdom and epcot be by far where i like to spend most of my time . of course animal kingdom and hollywood studio ( which be get a name change soon ) be both great park in their own right . they have an array of hotel rag from value , moderate , to deluxe . i have stay at each level at least once . port orleans riverside and wilderness lodge be be i like to call home on most my visit . both be beautifully theme resort that offer great pool , room and great staff . now on to food which be a big part of the disney experience . you will see people absolutely hate the food here and complain about the pricing . i solely believe those be the people who only eat from the hot dog stand or burger joint inside the park . they don ' t go to sit down/ table service restaurant inside or outside the park . now every restaurant isn ' t great on property but their be some real stand out one . for example , below be some of my faves resort cape may cafe at the beach clubtrails end at fort wildernessohana at polynesian resortartist point at wilderness lodge landscape of flavor at art of animation magic kingdomliberty tree tavern pecos bill tall tale innepcot sunshine seasonsyorkshire county fish shop animal kingdom tusker houseyak and yeti downtown disneywolfgang puck express earl of sandwich",1,389

"so we check in and they ask u to upgrade to balcony room and we decline it would of be an extra $ 100. i flash my marriott reward black visa card and instantly get upgraded for free ! the room be amazing . everything be clean . do smell like cigar smoke so i make sure i call front desk to tell them cause i didn ' t want to be charge when it wasn ' t me , and didn ' t want to be move . i have a bad ankle so i ask for a top floor close to the elevator and he give me exactly what i want . the pool be amaze . even if not a kid check out the kiddy pool slide be fun and so be play bball with the kid . on adult side of pool order your drink at the bar . one server for the huge pool be crazy wait 40 min for someone to take my order and then wait forever to get my check so my bf go to pay the bill at the bar and they need the waitress to close it out so that take another 20 min to get her . drink be good but over price $ 33 for 2 drink not include tip . so much chlorine in pool , and not heat . hot tub be nice . and the pool open till 11pm which be also nice . restaurant moor be the best thing here . do not dine in steak house it ' s like an upscale outback have to return my steak it be raw ! ! !

"we visit during the last week of february , one of the lowest volume week , and leave before the leap day 24 hour event kick off . the bad : check- in be not great . the staff in the lobby be super friendly , engage my 3 year old and give her a balloon . the woman at the desk who check u in seem much le than thrill to be at work , and no one even mention that we be celebrate our wedding anniversary and my daughter ' s first visit ( i know most people receive pin for both of these ) . our room be not ready right away , so we head out to the park . bus transportation be alright ; there be time when there be an abundance of bus for certain location and not enough for others , but that isn ' t the hotel ' s fault . hotel staff also do not tell u how to obtain our refillable mug for the dining plan , so we have to walk back up to the main building to get them after walk all the way to our room behind the second pool . the building adjacent to ours be be renovate , which mean lot of noise during our daughter ' s nap time . someone from housekeep throw away a measuring cup for my daughter ' s medication , but the concierge do replace it with one from some medicine in the store . the good : the room be clean and obviously the price be lower than the other resort . the food court serve better than expect food , although we only eat there once before head to the airport . the main pool be nice and they offer activity daily . there be a lot of younger guest ( mostly cheerleader ) whose chaperone do a pretty terrible job of keep them under control . i call security about the screaming and run take place during quiet hour and they take care of it right away . all in all , it be somewhere to rest our head and get the benefit of stay on property , and i would most likely stay here again if i be on a restricted budget .",1,388

"i book this on a discount website know it be just a basic hotel , but wow what a horrible experience . # 1- under construction . we be issue the wrong room upon arrival . after wait for a new room , we find out it be locate in the area of the hotel that be under renovation . i can appreciate a hotel try to maintain it ' s image , but with someone with severe allergy , i would not have book a hotel under construction this should ' ve be on the website . there be dirt , broken baseboard and dead bug everywhere and there be an overall wet dog smell throughout the entire hotel . # 2- bad service . it be impossible to get into our room . our room key wouldn ' t work more than once at a time , mean we ' d have to walk to the front desk ( on the other side of the hotel ) to get them recode every time we need to get into our room . we be there 2 day and we visit the front desk 4 time because of the key . never once be we offer an apology , just a bunch of excuse . # 3- poor condition . not to mention , the room be disgust . the wet dog smell carry into the room . the shower head and sink leak , leave a nice size puddle at all time . we have to use the towel to dry the area so we wouldn ' t fall . the mirrored closet door be crack and break , a huge hazard for anyone that have small child . and , there be dead fly in the bathroom . the breakfast be decent : bagel , toast , pastry , juice and coffee . the best thing about the hotel be the 10 minute walk/ $ 7 cab ride to universal/ island of adventure . don ' t bother with the shuttle . they leave the hotel late and come back early . we end up check out early and leave orlando because of the terrible experience at this hotel . the cheap price isn ' t worth it- stay away ! ! !",0,385

"we have a confirm reservation for thursday 12/ 11/ 14 and saturday 12/ 13/ 14 with embassy suite on jamaican court in orlando , fl . we could not stay on friday because we have make plan to visit family in a different area of florida . when we come back into town on saturday morning we talk with the person at the front desk and explain that we have a wedding to go to saturday afternoon ( shuttle be pick u up at 2 : 30pm because wedding be in a private country club ) . we ask if there be any way that we could check in earlier than the 4pm check in time . the attendant say she ' d see what she could do . we keep check back with her every 30 minute in the hope that there would be a room available so we could get ready for the wedding . at 1 : 30 we ask again and the attendant say `` you can always use the lobby bathroom ! `` so in a hotel that have probably 500 room , the cleaning staff couldn ' t get one room clean before 1 : 30 ? we tell the attendant our situation and she be not willing to work with u . so we end up change for the wedding in one of the other wedding guest room , barely make the shuttle to the wedding . when we get back to the hotel at 1 : 30am we be tell that they have no room . we have a confirm reservation , the front desk know we be in town and want the room . there be no explanation give or any regret felt by the attendant at all . they find u a room at one of the hilton hotel which we have to drive to and didn ' t get to bed until after 2am . we be blow away by the lack of professionalism on the part of the embassy staff . the embassy suite hotel chain be definitely not what it use to be . i even contact the corporate office for embassy/ hilton hotel and have not receive any response back from customer service personnel . we be very dissatisfied customer !",0,385
"pure shade from the management team , and i use the term `` team '' loosely . let hope new gm edward fagan make some change . just return from a ten night stay . my 9 year old have an accident in the hotel room that require medical care , and shade of green be more concerned with chain of command than the care of my child . when the incident happen the hotel operator offer to send a nurse , when the front desk get on the phone the guy argue with me for 5 minute say he would send security and not medical help . when security finally arrive , of course they could do nothing , they offer to call a van to send u to urgent care , that take another 40 minute . shade of green must have a contract with centracare , thats who show up and thats where we go . another scary adventure , be first tell there be no fracture only to get another call 7 hour later say oh we do see a fracture but we be close so come back in the van tomorrow . thankfully disney take u to the park medical team which include a nurse and team of paramedic , they be wonderful and help get u to a different medical facility where we get better treatment . when i call shade of green and try to talk to gm edward fagan about the incident i be tell he be in meeting , unavailable to speak to guest and that i need to understand how to follow the chain of command which land me back with a front desk supervisor , a security supervisor and finally with the front desk manager who couldn ' t understand why i would want to go any further . i do get a call from the assistant gm who tell me he be in meeting and he couldn ' t understand why i wasn ' t satisfy speak with security . never once do anyone call to inquire about my daughter . when i call to get a copy of the security report i be tell that be the property of shade of green . frozen be how i felt after this experience .",0,385
"i ' ve be to so many hotel that don ' t have good help at the front desk . it always put a bad start to a vacation when you be greet by a rude person . the lady that check u in be so nice and helpful . we get to the hotel after a long red eye at 8am and ask if by chance the room be ready and she say yes . unbelievable . she even comped the roll away bed . just really good service . i think for sure this be just a great employee and we will see some bad one , but it never happen . everyone be nice there and want to please you . just amaze . the pool be wonderful . the kid could go swim while we tuck away into the jacuzzi because they have at least 4 life guard on hand all the time . they have a lady that entertain the kid and make sure each have a noodle and beach ball to play with . it be wonderful be able to have a conversation with your husband after run around harry potter world all day with the kid . they get to swim around and unwind while we get to relax in the jacuzzi . they also have a pool and ping pong table next to the pool . the poolside restaurant be good . the service be better than 4 season . they don ' t spritz you with evian water like the 4 , but they be more attentive and just nice . warning ; the room service food be not good . i order chicken soup and it be part oil/ broth . couldn ' t eat it . my kid get mac and cheese which they didn ' t finish because not that great . i ask my daughter why she didn ' t eat her fruit and she say she couldn ' t bite thru it . not ripe . the turkey sandwich be good though . my suggestion be stay by the pool and order a pizza while the kid play instead of get room service . i would stay there again and i ' m look at other loews site to visit .",1,385
"this would have easily be a four star review if we hadn ' t be place in steerage during our stay . the hotel itself be nice and new with a cool retro design . the room be a bit on the small side but plenty of space for two people . i have request a king room but receive two queen . not a huge deal but a bit annoy . when i check in the girl at the front desk be friendly enough but be preoccupy by talk to her friend work next to her . our room be in the americana building , and if you be stay in this building i highly suggest you valet your vehicle so you can walk through the lobby to get to your room . we choose to self- park ( at $ 12/ night ) , and the parking area for this building be behind the continental building . it be right across from americana , but you can ' t simply walk across to it . you have to walk all the way around the pool and continental building , result in a 1/ 4 mile walk from your vehicle to your room . sure , a quarter mile isn ' t that far , until you take into account all the luggage that you need to tote combine with several mile of walk while at universal studio . it seem like an eternity get back to our room after a long day at the park . we get back very late from disney one night and get the very last parking space in the garage . you can either take a shuttle or walk to universal , and we walk the 1 . 2 mile through the universal garden walk . the walk be fine and the foliage be really pretty . we do not take advantage of the hour- early admission to island of adventure , but it ' s nice to know that be an advantage . there be a starbucks on site , but every time i try to go there be approximately thirty people in line . no thanks ! i wouldn ' t mind stay again , but i ' d request a closer build next time .",1,385
"the hotel overall be ok , definitely wouldn ' t consider it a resort . the overall look and feel of the hotel be nice . it ' s update , the decor be clean and streamline , and the amenity be fair ( 24 hr gym , spa , pool , 2 bar and 2 restaurant ) . however much be lose in the detail . all the linen and towel be so scratchy it be borderline unbearable . i have semi sensitive skin and the sheet make me itch all night long . the lampshade in the room each have a few dent in them , which be a little surprising give how the decor be update . the internet didn ' t work in our room , it would connect but we couldn ' t load page or access our email . we be on a business trip so this be a huge drawback . we end up have to go down to the lobby to get any kind of signal . we be work out of the hotel bar most night . it be there that we meet the friendly bartender , gary , who be the gem of our stay . he be very friendly and kind and boy do he make a great mojito . the hotel have these silly game that they do in the lobby a few time a week . if you win these game you can get a prize . . . allegedly . i win a game and never get a prize . they say they would get it to me and then just never do . they end up give u a free soda and coffee when we check out to make up for it . so i guess that ' s something ? over all it ' s not a bad place to lay your head for a few night . it ' s definitely try too hard , though . maybe an attempt to stand out among all the competition in the area . the friendly staff be a plus- except the manager who tell me i have win a prize and then never follow up after i call the front desk . be a little disappointed in that .",1,384
"they overbooked the hotel and try to put u in another property with a much lower room rate . i ' m 7 month pregnant and i have a 2 year old . we look forward to our vacation for wyndham bonnet creek for month and prepay our booking . i call the day before to confirm the reservation and to check if they could check u in early since our flight get in at 5am . at that time they verify that we have a room in a 1 bedroom deluxe suite . since they say there be no early check in i check in later in the day , and the front desk agent say they couldn ' t locate our reservation . i show him the confirmation and say we already pay for the stay month in advance . he go in the back to get a manager . we be in the lobby for hour try to get thing resolve with tatiana the assistant front desk manager who repeatedly tell u due to low inventory , there be no way they could accommodate u . i be in tear because i look forward to this vacation for month . they try to put u in their sister property which be half the cost per night but i didn ' t think that be fair since i book this hotel room for the amenity and the location . we also have a hard time find another hotel last minute that can accommodate u for an entire week . none of the disney hotel have availability . i mean this be a vacation at disney world where hotel book month in advance . please beware when book a room with wyndham . even the episode of undercover bos show them overbooking room . later that even i call about 10pm when we still couldn ' t find a hotel . the other assistant manager on duty , eron wouldn ' t take my call although he tell me he would help me when he introduce himself while i be still cry at their lobby . overall , i ' m emotionally traumatize from this experience . i hope they don ' t do this to anyone else in the future .",0,383
"after hear all the positive review for this hotel i go into it with maybe too high expectation . the hotel itself be really nice look , the retro theme be right up my ally and i throughly enjoy the lobby and all the fun amenity . then i get into the room . the room itself be nice , but the people stay next to u have at least 4 kid in one room and we could every word , every cry , every thing go on in their room . it be around 10pm when we decide to go down to the lobby and ask to change room . i must say that the girl that help u behind the counter be very nice and helpful , and be able to get u into a new room . she do mention though that it be a `` family resort '' and something that should have be expect , but then mention that the noise level complaint be one she get frequently since the wall weren ' t sound proofed . i would think that a `` family resort '' over any resort should have room that have some sort of noise cancellation ! the new room prove to be quieter , but i could still hear the room next to u brush their teeth and cough occasionally . for the price i pay i can ' t justify recommend this resort to anyone . the wall shouldn ' t be so fine a to hear the person in the next room coughing ! final straw for me be my realization that i leave my favorite beanie in the room after check out . i call lose and find and have to describe to the person help me what a beanie be , and wasn ' t even ask what room number i leave it in . after be on hold for maybe one minute max he come back and say , `` nope it ' s not here. `` i hope whoever find the beanie be enjoy it , and a for me , i will not be back . extremely disappointing . save your money and stay off property , you will probably enjoy a much quieter night sleep .",0,383
"we just get scammed . we be give food voucher from the orlando welcome center a part of our vacation package . when we book , we be charge extra for all our meal to be include . the package do not include tip or ' service charge ' . we have our voucher present to our waitress before we order . we eat a four course meal during happy hour with drink at buy one get one free . we be never tell what the hotel value of the voucher be . ivan bring u our ' mango ' margarita only there be no hint of mango in it nor be it ' buy one get one free ' for happy hour . ivan ' s reasoning be because it ' s not like a gin & amp ; tonic or rum & amp ; coke with just one liquor . i know that the margarita i be serve have only tequila & amp ; margarita mix not even mangoes a i order . we want to order lobster bisque & amp ; chicken tortilla from their print menu but unfortunately only one out of the five choice of soup on their menu be available- chicken noodle . i should ' ve know at this time that we ' re already in for trouble . we be entice by item on the menu that be post outside of the restaurant . unfortunately , most of those item on the advertised menu be not available . beware of false advertising . do not even come in unless you ask the hostess about whether they really have the stuff in their menu that you want to eat . appetizer be serve , then salad , then entrees . the scallop in my pasta dish be but six in number on half a pound of lightly season pasta with barely any pesto . my husband ' s t- bone steak be okay . when we get the bill , our server tell u that she can only apply $ 20 for a dinner for two . our bill be $ 97. who eat with a $ 20 credit on a supposed luxury vacation trip . beware , don ' t get scammed ! ! !",0,383
"i book this hotel inadvertently through a priceline `` express deal '' since it be the cheapest hotel in the area i select that meet the minimum requirement for a three- star hotel out of all the flashy name of upscale hotel they say i might get . the room have definitely be nicely update , however , the outside of the hotel look very dated and i think paint the orange doors a different and more modern color would do wonder to improve the look of the resort , but let ' s face it , the word spa need to be remove from the hotel ' s name . the outside of the resort do not really inspire much confidence when it come to safety but it be nicely care for and the three pool be rather large and have a decently tropical vibe . once you enter your room , though the hotel feel much newer and they definitely do what they could to upgrade the room and make them feel a update a possible . the furniture be pretty nice , the bathroom be good ( although there be a stray straw on the floor that be not ours ) , and the bed be quite comfortable which be nice after a long day at disney world . one thing definitely worth note about this hotel be it location . you can not really get much closer to the main entrance of the walt disney world resort unless you stay onsite which be a complete ripoff since these room would be twice a expensive there . all you do be make a right out of the hotel , follow the sign for disney world , and you be there around five or so minute later . you can even hear and kind of see some of disney ' s firework from the hotel which can be cool or annoy depend on how you want to look at it . overall this isn ' t the nicest hotel near disney but it be certainly one of the closest and if you can get it for a good price then it ' s a pretty good choice , just don ' t expect much of a resort or spa .",0,382
"i can not express in word how terrible this place be from every perspective . i should have know that a i enter the hotel after a trip to universal , and witness what could only be construe a an escort be pick up , that the stay be go to be le than pleasing . firstly they charge a $ 10 . 00 clean fee on top of your booking , which be total garbage because the room , and the common area be disgust . from the random furniture , to break furniture strewn about the property , hole in the wall that be patch and not paint ; i ' ve see housing project with more class than this hotel . throughout the entire building we stay in , all i could smell be marijuana wafting through the air , i have never stay at an establishment that so little thought be give to the safety and concern of it ' s guest . the deadbolt be so loose a child could have break into the room sans effort . the room be extremely unkempt - hair on the pillow etc , random furniture . an enormous refrigerator that look like it belong in someone ' s home 20 year ago , complete with rust stain . we sleep fully clothe with hood on , because i didn ' t feel safe actually sleep in the bed . we do not shower or use any of the facility other than the toilet , but beyond that it be pretty scary . the `` continental '' breakfast be toast and cereal , not sure what kind because i do not get close enough to see , but that be it , a big basket of bread and a toaster . we opt out of our toast breakfast , and get real breakfast somewhere else in orlando . honestly stay somewhere else , it ' s worth the extra money you ' ll spend . just a sidebar i be book this hotel because my airbnb fell through , the picture they post make the hotel look ok , but trust me , it ' s beyond terrible , sleep in my car would have be a better alternative .",0,381
"i get a reservation for this place through priceline . often time one get what they pay for from this method of secure lodging . i be go with my husband , his sister and daughter to disney . i think a simple `` crash pad '' for the night after a tiring disney day would be fine enough . boy be i wrong ! ! ! it really blow me away ! ! wow ! this place be amaze . my first step through the door i be greet by an ultra- modern interior . like a w hotel only at a quarter of the price . very chic , modern and all brand new ! it didn ' t stop there ; the friendliness of the hostess at the reception desk . she be right on point . she be very nice and chatty . obviously they do expert training on the staff . i could not have be more initially impressed . and i be hard to impress ! lolthe hotel be clearly an older place that have be update . they do a great job it they be still work on it however and the pool area be a work in progress . the lobby be so impressive and chic i just have to hang out there and read the morning paper with a cup of tea . they offer free wall street journal and u today paper . the sofa be so comfortable ! love hang out there in the morning . there be a cute little cafe and coffee bar with pastry . a wine and liquor bar a well . too bad it be so cold a the pool look wonderful . the gym look very nice a well . it be all non- smoking a well . how good can it get ! we have and issue with no coffee cup in our room . i go down to the lobby and a warm and friendly receptionist give me some right away . the only downside i can see be they charge $ 15 for self- park . this be clearly just gravy a there be adequate parking in the lot and area . overall i would give it a resound 10 .",1,381
"i be pray that i choose the right place for my recent trip to orlando and hampton really didn ' t disappoint me . first of all i get the room for $ 70 a night thru priceline . i get the date change directly by the hotel right away with no hassle and great friendly customer service . the place be very clean both on the common area of the lobby and eating section for breakfast a well a the room . one thing that will make me cringe be a dirty hotel and this one seem to have be very well keep and possibly recently refurbish . the room be a perfect size for 4 people max , 2 queen bed and they have a plasma a well a a mini fridge with freezer and a microwave which come in super handy . the bathroom be fully equip with plenty of towel and a double sink and tub . the area and the breakfast by far be the best perk . the free buffet breakfast be very well appoint from mickey waffle ( they be ok ) to yogurt , some type of egg , fruit , cereal , all type of pastry . there be also a quick grab bag they have by the front of the front desk if you need to leave early and don ' t have time to sit down and eat . it be great on the day we have to leave on their shuttle ( free again ) to epcot . make sure you be on time or they will leave you . . . another awesome thing be free coffee & amp ; tea 24 hr a day & amp ; when you need that surge of energy or in my case i have a tummy ache from overindulge at the food and wine at the epcot festival there be plenty of chamomile to settle my tummy . the area be super close to downtown disney and also the park . about 10 min from some of them . the highway ( i- 4 ) which take you to the park be about 3 minute away . i will definitely come back and recommend to any friend or family .",1,380

"i stay here last night while in town for some halloween activity and i have a lovely time . the atrium be gorgeous . . since i really didnt research the hotel at all before come to town it be an unexpected surprise . the room be spacious and clean . the bathroom be also very clean and there be lot of room . i like it when the bathroom be sort of split in two . . the toilet and shower in a small room and then the sink just outside of that . it make thing run allot quicker when you have a group of people try to get ready to head out for the day/ night since no one be fight for the mirror/ sink/ shower . we have a small balcony which we could not access , think it be strange but since we be only there two day we didnt really spend too much time in the room . there be an alligator feed on certain day , always at 6 : 30 which be really cool . get there a little early ( 20 min ) because a crow form quickly and you want to be able to see the feeding . the hotel be very beautiful , you could get lose in all the hallway , and different theme area inside . expect resort pricing for everything . the only thing about the hotel that be a little bit annoy be that any time we call the front desk for anything we be put on hold for at least 5 minute . also , we have request something for our room and we have to call a couple of time to ask for it . . it never come , and we have to go downstairs and get it ourselves from someone else . also there be a $ 15 resort fee and parking overnight be $ 13. lastly , i read a few other review on the place where people compare it to a la vega hotel . that . be . not . true . i have be to vegas , and this resort be no vega hotel . it be beautiful but you can not compare the two .",1,379
"i stay at the hyatt last week while attend the zumba convention . i would have rat this hotel 5 star due to their amazing staff and awesome room , but the one thing that really bother me be how they handle my credit card . i be share my room for the 5 day i be there and my roommate for the time pay for everything when she make the reservation . because i be the first to arrive , a expect , i be ask for a credit card when checking in . of course i didn ' t mind this at all a it have happen at every hotel i ' ve stay at before . however , throughout the 5 day , random hold of different quantity be be place on my account . my roommate and i talk to the front desk and they assure me that the money would all be release after check out . i be ok with this and let it all slide . everything be ok and a promise , all of the hold be release on sunday and my money be return . i get home on monday and check my account , make sure everything be ok , and continue about the routine of bill pay . yet , to my dismay , i wake up on tuesday morning only to find that my account be overdraw by $ 468 ! ! ! i immediately log on to check what be happen and realize that all of the charge from the hyatt be add once again . . . all of them ! ! ! i think they be no longer able to touch your credit card once you ' ve check out ? ! of course i immediately contact the hyatt and my bank and after an hour phone call , they finally decide to give me my money back with a , `` 6- 8 business day delay '' . luckily i be able to get my money reimburse and the overdraw fee reverse . although everything else of my stay be amaze , this really bother me and be make me rethink my visit with the hyatt for next year ' s convention .",0,379
"i book a hotel at the last minute . i have extend my stay post a work relate conference to enjoy some time in orlando with some friend . i decide 2 night before my conference end that i would book a pkg through the disney website . i actually get a pretty good deal consider that i buy 5 day park- hopper pass that do not have an expiry date . the hotel itself , at the last minute , come up to be about $ 132/ night ( and i only stayed one night ) . yet , what i like about the hotel be that it be family/ kid friendly , there be complimentary shuttle to take between the hotel and theme park ( the closest park to this hotel be animal kingdom ) . plus , they offer the magical express ( round- trip transportation btwn mco airport and the hotel ) . plus , despite the chaotic , loud atmosphere ( which be really geared towards kid and family on a budget ) , the staff be typical sunshine- y disney cadet . ( i should know , i use to work for the mouse ) . so , my experience be all good for the time frame and purpose . i do want to set your expectation though . don ' t expect luxury ( it be like a glorified , mickey- fied motel 6 ) . there be limited room service ( pizza ) and there isn ' t a restaurant , per se , but a cafeteria like food service area that be open until 9 or 10 where you can pick up a quick bite ( not necessarily nutritional ) . the wall be sort of thin and navigate around to your building may be a little confusing ( even with a map ) if you don ' t pay close attention . the building be set up in an open- air cat- walk type of arrangement . if you don ' t have a rental car ( like me at the time ) and want to have easy transport for a wdw vacation and be on a budget , this might be the perfect choice for you .",0,378
"this be a good budget resort hotel in the area that include bus transportation to the amusement park . if you be look to save some money , i would recommend you consider this hotel or the wyndam next door . note however , there be some negative with this best western : - the room smell musty and seem a bit oldish . - while the shower water pressure be good , the water temperature seem to fluctuate from time to time . one morning , i could only get completely hot water out of the shower and i have to call the front desk who promptly send up a maintenance guy . he fix it by run the shower while flush the toilet a few time . apparently , this help `` bring the cold water '' , strange . one my week- long stay here , i have to do this once more myself but it be no problem since i have learn how . - the `` free breakfast '' include with my room package be basically just coffee fruit and cereal , no egg bacon or sausage . you have to pay a $ 9 . 00 upgrade charge for that . - the front desk employee be not that friendly , however the restaurant staff be . - the location be quite a distance from the resort , although it ' s closer to epcot than magic kingdom . when you take a bus back , it could take up to 45 minute . a cap ride be about $ 25. from magic kingdom and $ 20 from epcot . on the plus side , the room include a fridge ( but no microwave ) and the location be just 5 minute from a shopping center with several restaurant include a sweet tomato ( all you can eat salad bar ) , friday , and uno pizza a well a a grocery/ drug store . for the price , i don ' t really have any complaint about this hotel a i do save quite a bit of money versus stay a a higher- end resort in the area . that say , you do get what you pay for .",1,377
"we be look to stay at a nicer , resort- like facility in the orlando area for 2 day and be shock and disturb how this two- day $ 225 stay turn into a $ 315 stay with the addition of service fee and an unrefundable $ 65 clean fee that be precariously hide in the * note section* in the final documentation that i print out from and book through . they never mention this a i reserve it . i need to rebut the previous commenter , because it be true , a little scammish . then again , the best reason for subscribe to yelp ! be to find this out ahead of time . . . so caveat emptor . this 3 bedroom `` villa '' be a mini- condo . now to be fair , we own an interval international timeshare resort for 20 year now and have trade for 12- 14 florida area resort and this one do not stack up . we have a bottom floor unit with two 4 ' x10 ' balcony area that only two people could squeeze onto if the humidity would have be more comfortable . . . it be bizarre look and unusable . the 12 ' x14 ' master bedroom have a queen- sized bed and a 17 '' crt tv hang from ceiling ! ? ! no armoire . a 32 '' flatscreen in the lr . . . i could barely see it from the couch . the carpet by the front door be well worn past it replacement time . we do not use their outdoor bar mambo . the pool be warm , not cool . this be more evident after we leave and stay at the imperial palm resort on international drive in orlando where the pool be perfect and the price be $ 75/ night ! we do not use either restaurant . the front desk be courteous . we didn ' t take advantage of the free rental movie , but that ' s a good feature . i try to fight the $ 65 cleaning fee for the 2 night stay , and they don ' t budge . would not stay here again .",0,377
"my husband and i stay at the hard rock hotel for four night from january 20 , 2013 to the 24th . we choose this hotel for two reason : 1. the purpose of our trip be to go to universal orlando . we want a hotel that be within walk distance to the park . 2. we have stay at the hard rock resort in punta cana , dominican republic last year and be impress with the quality and detail of the hotel . a for our experience with the theme park , i ' m very happy with the benefit from the hotel . we have no problem get the express ticket and these ticket make our day at the park much more enjoyable . the hotel quote a walk of around 10 minute from the hotel to the park , but it be actually closer to 7 minute . when we get soak , unexpectedly , on one ride , it be convenient to be able to walk back to our room to change . a for the quality of the hotel itself , i find myself disappointed . the room seem date and they be quite bland . at their hotel in punta cana , there be some detail that add to the overall effect of the hotel , such a embroidered guitar on the pillow case . in orlando , there be no detail like this so , other than the standard literature on the hotel room desk , it could have be any generic hotel room . other review have note that they charge for everything extra and this be true . internet be advertise a $ 10/ day . when purchase the internet , i be offer higher quality internet for $ 15/ day . because i know that i would not be in the room much , i choose the lower amount . for the entire four day , though , popups frequently appear try to upsell me to the higher package . the connection be also slow and drop often . overall , if i be to go to universal again , i would probably try out one of the other two property on the resort ground .",1,377
"remember that episode of break bad ? * spoiler alert* the one with the atm machine and the tweakers and jesse crushing that guy ' s head ? ? remember the crack den they be in ? i ' d kill to have stay there over this hell hole . where do i even begin ? the sheet be dirty , hair not of my own on the sheet , pillow , towel . outdated , dirty fixture , grimy carpet , stain on the wall and floor . the room look like a crime scene , honestly . not to mention a television from 1993 and a door that do not properly shut . we return on one occasion to see that even housekeep be unable to properly shut our door . thank god nothing be take . it be truly a shock to arrive back and see our door open . the complex here be huge . massive ( stain and crack ) paint concrete/ terra cotta monstrosity with no elevator , cigarette urn at every turn , ciggie butt every step . just nasty . on top of all this , somehow the place seem to be over staffed . staff zoom around on loud gas power golf cart ( even after midnight ) drinking beer ( i wish i be joke ) a group of maid hang out in the closet laugh together . it ' s just madness . with all of this staff , you ' d think the place would be pristine ! there be a bottle of hotel sample lotion on the ground around the corner from our room . it stay there , on the ground , from the day we check in till the day we check out . 5 day of people walk by , 5 day of supposed cleaning . madness . i guess in the end , this be my fault . i literally get what i pay for . i pay very little to stay here and get very little in return . my fault . finally , the icing , there be a resort fee for this motel . a resort fee . just nibble on that for a little bit .",0,377
"we go here last month a an anniversary/ christmas/ valentine ' s present to ourselves . we ' re orlando local , and have only stay on disney property once , at the all- star sport resort . now , the all- star resort be great if you ' re look for a decent place to sleep and a few pool a a bonus , but the yacht club be worth it a a ' deluxe ' disney resort . after do my research , i find that each of the deluxe resort be within a very short distance ( walk , boat ride , or monorail ) of at least one of the park . we choose the yacht club because we like the idea of walk to epcot , and be able to stroll around the boardwalk at night . in addition to the entertainment and food option at epcot and boardwalk , you also have the next- door beach club , swan , and dolphin hotel for additional restaurant option . we stay three day and night and be able to sample a different restaurant for each meal , and never use our car the whole time ; just walking . it be a very relaxing time . we felt that the restaurant , room , service , pool , amenity , and location be all ideal . one thing that i will caution be that the resort be very spread out - i read this comment several time in review but didn ' t really understand it until i get there . when initially walk to our room ( which felt like it be at the end of the earth ) , i think it take u upwards of 15 minute to walk there from the lobby if we stick to the interior corridor . walk outside ( if the weather be good ) can save you time , and the view be really nice . bottom line : if you have the money to stay at a deluxe disney resort , this be a great option with nice amenity , good service , attentive housekeeping , great option for nearby restaurant , and the convenience to other attraction be wonderful .",1,376
"this hotel be okay . it be clean and the staff be generally pleasant and helpful . my issue be rather likely with ihg u ( who seem to enjoy run hotel into the ground ) . the first day , the guy at the counter try to tell u all parking be $ 9 per day . long story short : the website say free self- parking which we have to show to him to prove it . i guess he be try to force u to use valet ? it ' s call a bait n switch where i come from . smooth sail from there on out until the last day . i be have some significantly disable stomach problem ( have an autoimmune disease will do that to you ) so i ask for a late checkout . they be very firm : no late checkout ! ! i have be to many many hotel and have never have a problem get a late check out before . and their check in be at 4p ! come on : there ' s plenty of time . so here i sit , in the hallway next to the lobby bathroom , with my bottle of pepto , wait for my stomach to feel better . then i notice that this be an ihg hotel , a be the holiday inn i stay in in louisville which i write another review on . and then i noticed intercontinental be another hotel in their chain ! one day i ' ll yelp my ny intercontinental hotel experience : needle to say , i give plenty of opportunity to cure , but when the staff bring a replacement comforter that have blood spatter on it , i ' m pretty well disgust . that say , i think this be a u phenomenon . the intercontinental berlin have get to be one of the nicest hotel i ' ve ever stay in : up there with the st. regis and the ritz carlton ( at tyson ' s corner , at least ) . not to gripe but ihg hotel seem to always screw up my vacation so i ' m not risk it anymore .",0,376

"omg . well , first off , max , the night clerk , be wonderful . speedy check- in , nice guy . now for the room . i will list my observation and how they progressively lead to the low rating i finally end up give the property . 5 star : clerk ( max ) very good . room be huge and very clean . look great ! 4 star : room have wall- mount bedside lamp and a clock on the table between the two bed . just one problem : none of them work . this might be due to the fact that they aren ' t plug in . and that could be due to the fact that their electrical cord aren ' t nearly long enough to reach any outlet in the room . ( can you say `` extension cord '' ? i know you can ! ) 3 star : a/ c unit have paint spill on it . shower unit have a crack in it , and entire plumbing unit in it move when you turn on the shower . ring around shower head `` arm '' be rusty . numerous other area where sloppy workmanship be evident . 2 star : gathering my thing on my way out when i see these 3 or 4 tiny white bug scamper about on the table next to the tv . never saw bedbug before , and these didn ' t look like anything i look up on the internet- - more like genital crab ! yum ! i get a couple of bite , but nothing that resemble those from a bedbug . still , a delightful morning welcome ! summary : until the bug , i probably would ' ve put up with the other stuff and stay here again for the one night prior to my flight out of orlando . but the bug just put it over the top . what ' s really sad be that this property could easily have garner 4 or 5 star have the owner even feign an ounce of pride in this property .",0,361
"after read some of the other review , i have to say jamaica be the place to be for ease of transportation . you will be the first stop when return from the park and it be rare that we get stick on the bus route that take you all the way around the resort when head out . one major drawback to this property be the walking distance . depend on which island you be stay on you could be look at a hike to get to old port royale ( main restaurant area/ pool/ shop ) . have say that i be fairly impress with how quiet it be . to be fair , our last trip we be stay at art of animation , so sleep next to a cement factory would be quiet by comparison . the room be clean , spacious , and with a water view . the bathroom fixture be upgraded , but the water pressure be lack . the bed be comfortable and the caribbean be one of the only hotel that offer king room at a reasonable price . another drawback to stay here , if you be on the second floor . so if you have stroller , a lot of luggage , or an aversion to stairs , request a ground floor room . housekeeping be prompt and efficient and leave new coffee/ soap/ shampoo every day . the room have a nice coffee maker that can make two cup at once . overall , i think the room be great . the dinning option be not bad . the cafeteria offer variety and it never seem overly crowd . i be very impressed with shutter , the only table service restaurant on property . overall , we enjoy our stay . i be not sure the resort be really enough of a step above the value resort to be worth the extra cost . it also seem a though the staff be not a friendly/ accommodating a other resort . if you be look for a kid friendly hotel , check my review of art of animation .",0,360

"first , the positive thing . . . we stay in aruba , the room be a little small , but nice and updated . aruba be fairly close to port royale - after a long , hot day of walk around the park this be helpful ! the food court at port royale have a good variety and the pool be nice and clean . the bus stop be not too far , and the bus arrive in a timely manner . now the negative . . . the restaurant at port royale , shutter , be not good . our server be not friendly , terribly slow and the food be not worth the price ( thankful we be on the dining plan , or i would not have pay for my over- cooked steak ) . the most disappointing part of our experience at this hotel be the housekeeping . after we check out and get on the bus to the airport , i realize i leave something in the room ! i know exactly where i leave it and call the hotel right away . housekeep call me back le than 5 minute later and inform me they do not find anything . . . b ! my family and i know exactly where i leave it - i ' m sure they either didn ' t bother to look , take it or have throw it away . not the end of the world , but my daughter be very upset a it be a keepsake she get from magic kingdom . my sister also have some item go miss from her room during our stay . the staff be not very concerned about it and say they would `` investigate '' - nothing ever come of that . again , not the end of the world - it be just some pool toy and a pair of her son ' s short - but still , very irritate ! if it wasn ' t for these `` housekeeping '' issue , i would recommend this hotel and give it at least 4 star .",0,360
"don ' t go to the time share presentation . they say it be only 90 minute long , but we be there for 5 hour talk b with different representative . a half day sacrifice on a 4 day vacation be not worth it . our rep blab on about his wife , kid , life , and random fun fact that have nothing to do with the time share and we didnt even see the property until 3 hour in . i guess that be his attempt to get u to trust him and then fall into their little game of good cop bad cop with other reps. several other group be there for just a long a u , too . even when you tell them you be not interested , different representative come over with `` better '' deal and basically hold you hostage and dont take no for an answer . it be a nightmare . the gift they offer a incentive to go be not worth it - we be promise discount disney ticket for go but the discount only apply if you be go to disney for four day ( we specifically tell them we could only go to disney one day and they tell u we would definitely get some sort of discount . we find this out after waste 5 hour there ( 12 : 30pm- 5 : 30pm ) ) . so the incentive didnt even apply to u - we spend 5 hour there for no reason . we complain to management that we be lie to and have spend a half day there . the manager have hardly any sympathy , say it be basically our fault for go and be there that long , then offer u a pitiful coupon off of food and beverage . we do not think that be worth our time waste . we will never ever buy a time share from these people and hope that by read this review you will not get suck into the presentation either . the incentive be not worth it . enjoy your vacation .",0,359

"my wife and i live in celebration , and have be go to the hotel for year . we start come here when it be the celebration hotel , and i must say we ' ve notice a big change when it be buy by the bohemian . aesthetically , for me , the outside patio be 10 time better . unfortunately , this be the only thing that be better . our thing would be to go there before head to the tavern on a friday night , sit by the lake , have a cocktail or two , and have the filet mignon eggrolls . yes , you read that correctly . filet mignon eggrolls . these thing be so divine i reconstruct the recipe and make them at home . the last five time we ' ve be here the meat in the eggrolls be clearly not filet mignon ! ! the meat have be very tough and without fail have be very fatty . it ' s extremely disheartening a the dish fail because of it . in addition , my drink of choice be jd on the rock . i ' ve order them many time at the bar . all of a sudden ( again , after ownership change ) my drink come out in a glass that be only slightly bigger than a shot glass , with only one small cube . i ask for the normal glass , she say `` do you want a double ? `` i oblige and she bring out the glass i normally receive , and when i get my bill that cup of jack daniel have cost $ 22. keep in mind i have bartender for year in the area , and serve table here in celebration and this be not normal and i no longer can recommend this place until their act get together , and that be the most unfortunate thing for me , because it be a treat to take visitor from out of town to this little oasis for a snack that they can ' t get anywhere else .",0,358
"my boyfriend and i stay at the gaylord palm a a weekend getaway and have a wonderful time . we must have pick a good weekend , because when we arrive there be hardly anyone else in the resort ! we have a room that open onto the key west atrium , with a perfect view of the ship at the moor restaurant and all the fish in the lagoon . we love all the atrium and horticulture at the resort and have a blast walking through several time . we spend an afternoon at the adult only pool , which be quiet ( and to be honest , a bit boring . the kid sound like they be have a lot more fun. ) we spend some time play ping pong in the arcade . our bed be very comfortable and the room be clean . we be able to watch netflix from our flat screen which be a nice treat . my only critique be that you be nickeled- and- dim for everything - - the restaurant be prohibitively expensive for u to go to , especially when there be several much cheaper option just a few mile down the road . i would have love to go to the sunday brunch at villa de flora ( it look wonderful ! ) , but at $ 46 a plate , that just wasn ' t in our budget consider the cost of the room alone . even the coffee shop , the cocoa bean , sell coffee for over $ 5 a cup and there be no other option just to get a small breakfast item that wasn ' t absurdly overprice . we also pay $ 20 per day for park at the resort , which seem a bit over- the- top . all in all , we love the experience of stay at the hotel with our atrium view , but would have like to sample some of the restaurant at a lower price . i would recommend this if you be plan to spend a lot for a romantic weekend getaway .",1,357

"i always hold hotel to the standard to which they be expect to perform . anyone with common sense know that a $ 65 hotel will not provide the ammenedites that a $ 200 hotel will offer . so , what can you expect for $ 65 at this best western ? 1. good shuttle service to the airport : we get a 6am lift to the airport for our group of 13. driver be courteous , friendly . 2. a basic room . decent bed , but pillow be horrendous , unless you have a neck like a giraffe . like try to fit your head on a marshmellow the size of a pillow . shower , toilet , sink work . decor be circa- 1996. it be a good year , but not worth spending another night there . 3. clean enough . the desk have waterstains from someone else ' s soda can , but the rest of the room be clean ( at least to the naked eye . didn ' t bring by bacteria black- light this time ) . shortcoming ? 1. computer in room didn ' t connect to internet . i be jazz to see an in- room computer , but bum that it didn ' t work . good intention , i suppose . 2. highway traffic : heard several motorcycle hit rev limiter on the highway outside at 3 be . 3. limited eating option : like waffle house ? hope so . i didn ' t see the fitness room . . . pool be visable from our window , and it didn ' t look green , but it isn ' t locate in the most picturesque location , either . leave too early to get a chance to try out the breakfast offering . elevator be painfully slow . so , the question to ask , be whether or not it be a $ 65 hotel . i ' d say yes . 3 star for do $ 65 no better , no worse then $ 65 should do .",0,353
"first , be clear : this be not the sheraton next to downtown disney and i see that a lot of the reviewer be confuse about that . this be on vineland/ apopka about a 20- min commute from magic kingdom . i spend a weekend at this hotel a part of the gay days/ girl in wonderland event . every room in all four building be book with lesbian look to party - imagine a womyn ' s only spring break crowd . needle to say , this be not an easy crowd for hotel staff to manage ! i have come to this event and similar one , for many year , at different hotel . this be the first hotel i have see that be really up to the task . i be consistently awe by the graciousness and responsiveness of the staff , despite the all- hour nature of the event , the massive day- long pool party , the early morning after party , the inebriation , and the lack of maturity among the mostly 20something guest . not once do i hear exasperation , annoyance or impatience when we ask for more towel , late check- out , maintenance in the room , etc . yes , it do suck that they park your car 1 . 5 mile away at a charge of $ 10/ day . the food in the hotel be mediocre . ( we end up order indian food from eat24 ) . the audio and video component do not work on the treadmill in the fitness center . however , the pool be awesome and the bar staff at the pool be great . this be one hard- work staff , because by the time we check out on monday , the place look pristine , a if nothing more than a bridge club tournament have occur . if they manage the property that well during the madness of a circuit party that last for 4 day , i imagine they ' d do great on a le demanding weekend .",1,352

"we book this hotel through and get a pretty decent rate , but you clearly get what you pay for . my main issue here be with housekeeping . we walk in the room and the bed spread be torn/ tattered on three of the four corner . we have no coffee cup and no soap in the bathroom . none in the shower , none in the sink . we call , be tell they would rectify this , and we leave for universal for the evening . come back , still miss the same item . wake up , still miss the same item . go to universal for the day , come back , still miss the same item . they finally bring it to u after our third call to housekeeping . wake up the third and final morning to find they never empty the coffee brewer , they never replenish the coffee stock ( which be important to a coffee- lover to me , but just poor service overall ) . the front desk be slow . ac/ heat unit never shut off , unless you literally unplug it from the wall . water pressure fluctuate every time someone flush the toilet . they type in our wi- fi information incorrectly , so we be pay a resort fee which include wi- fi for no wi- fi for 24 hour . they waive the resort fee for that 24 hour , but it be just an inconvenience in the first place . this hotel be 10 minute max from universal , about 25- 30 to disney , depend on which park you ' re head . the pool look nice , the hotel bar look nice , and they ' re build a wawa on the corner . also be a walgreens within walk distance which be convenient . but , simply due to the inconvenience and oversight from housekeep , we will not be back here . spend a little more and stay somewhere nicer .",0,342

"the hotel be fine , which be why i be provide 3 star . i feel that , base on what we pay for the hotel , we should have receive something a little nicer . there be nothing wrong , it be just okay . seem safe and clean . a bit dated . if the value be a little better ( i. e. cheaper ) it would have receive another star . the free breakfast have minimal option ( scramble egg ( each of the 5 day we stay ) some sort of meat , potato , pastry , bread , cereal , and a waffle station ) . the dinner be a generic mass cook pasta dinner . i be not complain . . but it be just okay . the front desk staff be very friendly , and the pool be nice . the free shuttle to disney ( which drop you off at epcot after stop by one more hotel ) be fairly convenient . here be a quick note about the shuttle , expect about 45 to 55 minute of travel time between the hotel and the front gate of the disney theme park , other than epcot , which be about 25 minute door to door . this time include a small travel time a second hotel pick up and to disney , and include time to travel between park . the drive to disney ( use your own car ) be only about 10 minute or so . two final tip : 1 ) we rent a stroller from simple stroller rental . great experience and low cost . it be wait for u at the hotel when we arrive . 2 ) the hotel call a cab for my family of 4 to the airport . the car show up 15 minute early , and be much cheaper than a ride share van to the airport ( since we have 4 people , and the ride share charge per person ) .",0,341

"all these people give this place terrible review be a little cuckoo . after all it be a hotel run by people who be only human and no one be ever perfect . they should lower their expectation a little or just take each thing with a grain of salt . for example people complain that they get an upgraded room that have a handicap shower , i stay in one of those room in november , the shower only have a little ledge to prop your foot on , not a full bench . plus it be a really nice shower compare to the one my sibling have in the connecting room which be also an upgraded room . our experience in november 2015 be amaze , we be go back later this month in april 2016. the staff be very accommodate and friendly , the restaurant be great , and the movie by the pool be an awesome experience ! the updated room be awesome ! our bed be so comfortable , these people be just be picky ( i mean really you ' re go to complain that the brightness on the tv isnt bright enough or the thermostat stop at 65 degree - go stay at the double tree across the street and then see if you still complain about rp ) . i love the universal movie channel they have on the tv ! i will say the only thing i be not a fan of be that the bathroom door ( which i be pretty sure do lock ) be very thin and any time one of u have to go to the restroom we make sure to turn the tv on because there be no privacy whatsoever lol . we also get to see them decorate for christmas which be beautiful ! the wifi be free for up to 4 device which i think be definitely fair . all in all this place be great and we cant wait to go back !",1,340

( i be dumb enough to get back on a second elevator two day later on the way out with bag but our family and another go on a bouncy ride to random floor for a good minute before it finally stop on the 2nd and open the door long enough to get out . but on a positive note , they remove the $ 13 . 50 fee for my elevator trouble. ) but ! if you ' re use to stay in hotel with name like day inn , knight inn , quality inn , etc , then you ' re in for a treat ! a far a we could tell , there be no bed bug and aside from mold , it be relatively clean . don ' t expect the standard base amenity like free water and tasty tea/ coffee but do appreciate the location near universal and the microwave with only minimal cook on food . a far a bottom of the barrel hotel go this one be near the top . we accidentally get stick with it from a botched priceline booking and decide to give it a shot . no matter how you spin it , this be bad . be there worse hotel ? yes - i ' d give them 1 star too - and expect to pay a lot le .",0,330

"this be no doubt a beautiful property . in fact , i be quite surprised it be label a hyatt regency and not their higher end line grand or park hyatt . the room be spacious and more upscale than your regular four star hiltons , marriotts etc . bathroom have a built- in tv in the mirror , so right there it be put you on notice that it want to be in company of four season and hitz carlton property , and in my opinion it be not too far from that objective . the travel book site i use rat this hotel 4 . 5 star , and i think that be an accurate rating . the service be excellent , with plenty of staff to meet all your need . the fitness center be outstanding , and they will even bring a set of free weight to your room upon request and free of charge . nice touch . the hotel have numerous pool , too many to count . the one i use be almost of olympic size , heat and just awesome . my intention be to give an excellent online rating for this hotel until i order room service , a simple pizza . what it be deliver be a disgusting pie about 90 % dough and 10 % topping . the quality of the meager topping , cheese , olive , mushroom , and sausage be abysmal , like they procure it from a dollar store . then i felt sick afterwards . you have to try very hard to mess up a pizza , but the hyatt regency orlando manage to do it . order their in room dining mar my up until flawless experience , thus my average rating . my advice be to stay at this property but steer well clear from their in- room dining which be not in line with this otherwise classy hotel .",0,328

"the staff be nice . . . . . . that ' s the only real compliment i can give . the lobby wasn ' t bad but be simple and look like it belong in the 1980s . the elevator be glitchy . the pool look like a community pool at a townhouse community . the breakfast buffet cost $ 22 per person . parking cost $ 17. no bell hop , at least no one help me . the uno cafe have awful service . i be on the 17th floor and my room wasn ' t bad , but my sister be in the 8th and it be atrocious . mildew , mold and the ac sound like drip water . mattress be old and lumpy and there be no room service ! just take out from a restaurant near by . i ask for a pizza ( which be on the menu ) and they have the audacity to say they didn ' t have any . if you ask for a view of universal , the closest thing you ' ll see be their parking lot . not to mention they have no transportation to universal , only a taxi that cost 7 buck to go . 5 mile . not to mention this hotel have zero amenity ! ( btw people be say that the cooky be good , which be true , but they contain nut . my sister be allergic to nut and when we ask for some without nut , they say they do not have. ) it be an outdated , filthy hotel and if you want to go to it because of it closeness to universal , don ' t. just go to one of universal ' s hotel or another that may be a bit more expensive per night , but it pay off , trust me .",0,320
"this be a great 3 star resort , just 2 mile from every type of food/ shopping establishment you can think of and the entrance to disney . we ' re a bit snobbish when it come to hotel and find the room comfortable and while not quite date yet , in another 2 year they will be . room and ground be impeccably clean , service be friendly and helpful . there be multiple pool that do get crowd so it ' s best to claim chair before 10 : 30 , otherwise you ' re likely out of luck . we take the timeshare tour which last almost 3 hour and while it ' s not particularly high pressure , if you want the `` goody '' you need to take the entire tour . $ 75 visa gift card , a $ 30 bike/ minigolf rental voucher- which we never use , a certificate good for a 2 night stay at the resort within 18 month and discount on attraction ticket . it be rain when we take the tour so we didn ' t mind . base on our rate this place be a steal . bedroom be large , full kitchen , live room , screen patio and a massive master suite with a full wall of mirror a a headboard- not a tacky a it sound , and it could be fun depend upon who you ' re travel with . internet be free so i ' m not sure what the other yelpers be refer to . there be schedule activity for kid , adult and family , some with a small fee and while we didn ' t partake , they sound fun . overall a great home base for disney . i ' d likely look elsewhere if i be only go to stay at the resort the entire time .",1,320
"hmmm . i ' m reading review over one star thinking . . . `` why ? `` i think i ' d give them the benefit of the doubt and then it hit me . the many reason you could give this place more than one star . let ' s look at just a few . 1 ) the group that bring you in be the mold collector convention and the spore find in the room , hall , around the tub and everywhere else around the hotel be very collectible . 2 ) you be blind and have no idea just how old and run down the carpeting , furniture and everything else be . 3 ) you enjoy the opportunity to smell new scent . there be opportunity to find a new scent in each and every room . 4 ) your bos really want you to quit and he put you in this hotel to give you a hint and you just didn ' t get it . 5 ) you want to relive the seinfeld episode with the soup nazi and deal with hotel staff give you that warm no one want to deal with you feel . 6 ) your convention be a group of elevator repair folk or even historian who want the chance to work daily on a rustic historic elevator daily . 7 ) you collect bed bug ! ! ! ! i ' ve get to be fair . this review may seem harsh and i want to be sure to let you know that i be kind . it could have be much worse . i didn ' t even play the `` name that stain '' game or `` what ' s that stick into the carpet ? `` maybe the next time i stay here . ummm . . . not gon na happen .",0,319

( seriously , this be a massive hotel , no king bed ? ) . i grumble a bit and they do manage to find u a king bed after all ( so somebody else get bump ) . the only other complaint that i ( and others attend the same event ) have be that it be just so far from the room to the ballroom . i mean , i ' m all for walking , but in high heel that be a bit annoy . additionally , there be only one group of centrally locate elevator that everyone have to use . that lead to a bit of congestion in the rather narrow hallway to the room . there ' s not much to be do about this , since it ' s such a huge hotel , but just keep in mind you will be walk a lot . other than the event we attend we didn ' t see much else of the hotel . if we stay again i would love to check out some of the restaurant inside . we saw the mexican restaurant make fresh guacamole at the table , and i love that , so it would be good to check out .",1,319

( yelpers beware . . . cab in florida be meter so don ' t let your driver punch in an inflated flat rate a ours did. ) . the facility be in general very clean , with a large outdoor pool and jacuzzi . . great usually except when there be a storm , which occur the day we be here . there be a hotel resort fee that give you 2 bottle of water and free use of the gym , business center and internet . this hotel be attach to a mall , so all you shopaholic should be happy . avoid the food court or use judiciously unless you thrive on junk food . the mall vendor be great with sample so fast food fan , rejoice . for others of a more healthy bent , walk out the mall and cross the street to panera , where you can get tasty food at reasonable price . one restaurant worth mention in the mall be ruby tuesday . . . great service and good food for the price . i would stay here again .",1,284
"i never really be much of a disney kid . . . . go there once when i be young - but i really have more fun at universal studio . and most of all place like six flags/ king island/ etc . there be a couple rid that give you a bit of a thrill but overall this place be just a giant money gobble tourist trap . yeah i say it . . . . it a trap . it really be though , you cant leave once you get there , unless you want to pay out the as for a cab ride . . . . there be a bus line or two ( orlando ' s public transit system ) but it doesn ' t run very often or very late . it be cheap though . oh and those public transit bus be hard to find too . to top it off they get rid of all the clubs/ bar in downtown disney/ pleasure island . . . . replace with overpriced restaurant and shop . so really the only worthwhile thing for 21+ people be epcot . the only reason i say this be because each country area there have beer/ drinks/ food form that country . this can make for a very fun night , especially on new year eve . italy and china have large dance floor with dj also on nye . i be not say i have to drink or go to a bar to have a good time . . . but it nice to do at least a few night out of the week when your on vacation , right ?",0,284
"i have to say i be impress with the pool area . we look at other resort while we be their and non have a big of a pool . if you have little kid definitely you want to stay here if you can ' t afford a disney resort . . . they cater to kid which be great . the pool area have a nice size slide , and at night they play disney movie for the kid . . . their restaurant be a bit high in price and not a lot of variety but then again all hotel be like that . be prepare to pay for `` resort fee '' of 25 $ per day which give you access to the gym spa golf course internet and parking . . . their be no microwave in the room but they do have a cafe in the lobby where you can microwave and toast bread . . . we be very happy with the location of the hotel very close to downtown disney and all the other park . . . but not with in walk distance . . . . if you have a rental car be better cause you can get around much faster . . . . the room be very nice and clean , best room to ask for be the one with the view of the golf course and pool . at night you can see the firework from your room which be nice . . . the fire work be a bit far but still visible . . . . very happy with the hotel . . . . . great customer service .",1,284
"we stay here from 2/ 11- 2/ 15/ 16. on the night of 2/ 13 ( 3am ) there be an all night party bus blare music on the parking lot . i contact the lobby twice and be tell it would be address , however it be not . the second time i contact the lobby , the desk clerk tell me she `` step outside '' but do not see anything . which would have be impossible a my room be on the third floor , nearly above the lobby . the bus be outside for a couple of hour , blare loud `` bass '' music '' , and there be several intoxicated young woman congregate in the parking lot . i bring this to the desk clerk twice that night . a well a the next morning , when i be leave the hotel for the day , and i be offer a `` free breakfast '' on my way out the door at 9 : 30am . i also bring this to the attention of the hotel when i check out on the 15th , but be brush off then , a well . perhaps this be just a marriott who care very little about their hotel guest a to allow a loud intoxicate bus party to go on all night in the parking lot for at least an hour after it be bring to their attention . twice . at 3am . a well a the next day . with photo . i would not recommend this hotel , nor will i stay there again . i be very disappointed in how this situation be handle .",0,283
"we have very high expectation for our stay at the grand bohemian this past weekend . have stay at the property when it be a hyatt when it be spectacular . we check into our room , and want to get ready for dinner , we pull the robe out of the closet and they be filthy . i don ' t mean just dirty that a housekeeper or supervisor could over look . i. mean like they have be use to wipe the bathroom toilet with . you get the picture . we call the front desk , they apologize and say they would send new robe right up . they didn ' t come until after we leave the room . they put the new rope on the bed and leave the old dirty robe on the floor in the bedroom without provide request turn down service . the hotel say it provide complimentary wifi in the room , which be true , kinda of . the problem be it doesn ' t work . when we call the front desk they tell use we be the only room complain about the wifi service and offer to change our room . the next morning at breakfast we learn from other guest that they to have complain about the internet service . there ' s nothing worse than a hotel manager that lie , and make it seem like it the guest fault . we get no apology , or any attempt to make it right . i ' m in hotel at least once a week for business . this be a complete disaster . don ' t waste your money",0,283
"good cheap disney resort . if you be look for a budget trip to a disney resort and wont be spend any time at the hotel than this place be for you ! the only good thing about this hotel be the price . another pro this hotel could have have be the free transportation from the airport , but on our way to the hotel the last stop be `` all- star music '' so we have to get off . then we have to find another bus to take u to `` all- star movie '' which take awhile . once we get to the hotel , the lady check u in be new and take age to get u the key and paperwork and forget to give u the pin for our meal for our disney band . once we get all settle in the room we try to get dinner at the hotel but could not because we do not have the pin for our band ( which they didnt give u ) so we have to talk to the manager/ go into their office and that take alot more time too since we have to re- activate everything . so our arrival wasnt very `` magical '' . the decor of this place be very old . we stay in the fantasia hotel and the room color be brown and not very disney but it be clean so i be happy about that ! they do have an outdoor pool which look like fun for the little kid ! they also have a restaurant which be open until midnight if you want a late night snack !",0,282
"i decide to surprise my husband with a `` nice '' hotel experience on the last day of our short trip to the orlando area in november . with the holiday special they be run , the peabody be a fraction of it normal cost , and on par with a lot of moderate hotel in the area , so i jump on it . check in be relatively fast ( maybe 5 or 10 minute ) . my husband park the car in the garage , and by the time he be back , i have key in hand . we have a fifteenth floor room with a nice view of the pool area . clean , comfortable and well appoint ( a it should be for their normal rack rate ) . greatly enjoy the lovely linen , towel & amp ; robe . so much so , that i fell asleep around 10 instead of go downstairs to enjoy a drink a plan . oh well . the room be great for lounge the next morning until we venture down to see the duck parade in , and then manage lunch at the diner and an afternoon on the deck of the rooftop pool . very relaxing and quiet . staff overall be friendly & amp ; helpful . they seem genuinely happy to help , whether tip or not . if i could get a similar deal , i would definitely stay here again . ala , my budget doesn ' t allow for hotel of this caliber most of the time , so i suppose a future visit would be far , far in the future .",1,282
"mehhhhh it ' s alright . let ' s start with the first impression . the ground be gorgeous . the aroma when you walk in be without amaze . . the restaurant there be delicious . . however our room look like a fucking rockstar stay there the previous night . i ' ve stay at several hilton brand hotel and this may be the nicest one i ' ve ever stay at but the room by far be one of the worst i ' ve ever stay at . my wife and i stay for six night and they do take care of all of the complaint about the room on day one however with a five- star hotel at their price range , i expect better then that . how do maintenance team and room service miss stain in the carpet , tear in the fabric of the couch tear , and a broken lamp . yes literally broken lamp on the nightstand be barely put together . my wife also have a skin reaction to the bedding . . . . now this be exactly a year ago and i still recall the detail of this hot mess . . . this be our honeymoon . we do receive a hotel credit for the inconvenience . all in all at the end of the day you can save your money and stay at the hilton next- door or spend a little bit more to stay at this waldorf a long a your room in good shape you win ' t be disappoint . . . make sure you eat at the steakhouse and get the tomahawk steak",0,281
"stay here for three night over christmas break . this hotel have a huge atrium lobby which make it attractive look . embassy suite be a very good value for a suite hotel in orlando . the room feature a big living room , bathroom in the middle which be modern , and then a separate bedroom with a very nice bed and it also have a separate sink/ vanity area inside which come in handy . it be a very clean and spacious suite . we have a view of the pool from the bedroom . the complimentary breakfast that embassy suite provide set apart from all the other hotel . they have a chef that make made- to- order omelet and a buffet with different breakfast food such a meat , egg , and potato and all the usual cereal , yogurt , fruit , juice etc . i also read that they have a manager reception with complimentary snack and drink during the week but i wasn ' t able to experience that . there be a cafe in the lobby and room service . the workout room ' s machine look up- to- date , however i didn ' t have time to take advantage of it . there isn ' t complimentary wi- fi but if you become a hilton honor member , you can receive free wi- fi . the only inconvenient factor be that walt disney world be a 20- 30 min drive but the embassy suit there be double the price so this location work out better . overall , i would recommend this hotel to family because of the spacious suite .",1,281
"this be the worst hotel ever . do not book here . we come to this hotel with a reservation from expedia for a non- smoking hotel with a kitchen . simple . however , when we open the door of our room , we be greet by a gut- wrenching smell of smoke . there be no pot and pan ( we have to ask for those ) . and the bathtub have this continual drip that couldn ' t be stop . the water have discolor the tub to be a green moldy figment . not only be these the issue , we ask on several occasion ( 4 time over 2 day ) to change our room to a non- smoking room , but on every occasion , they just say that they be all book and that our reservation through expedia actually didn ' t guarantee u a non- smoking room . we saw staff change sheet in non- smoking room , but the hotel say that the people have reserve those for a long time , and we be to stay in our own room . not only be this excuse of a management not able to provide u with a non- smoking room- - the bare minimum of what we request , when we ask for shampoo , they be out . the room don ' t clean daily . i ' m not actually sure if they clean them at all . this be the epitome of poor management and terrible customer service . it ' s because these rat demonize the hotel industry that i have lose faith in such a business .",0,281
"i would rate this place at zero star if it be possible . i read a myriad of mixed review on yelp and tripadvisor and still take the chance . huge mistake . the rollaway bed i pay for with my booking ( to accommodate our party of 5 ) be never bring up to our room until well after 1am ( we check in 5+ hour earlier ) . it take multiple phone call ( 20 min on hold for an operator ) , 2 trip down to the front desk and a wait for the manager , in order for the bed to arrive . everyone be apologetic , but when apology do not equal sleep , they be useless . the evening manager give u a resort credit and `` credit '' our rollaway bed charge back ( though in look at the final statement , this didn ' t happen . . . ) . we use the resort credit for some incidental and a meal at the fountain , which in and of itself , be a terrible experience . waitress totally ignore u , take our order , ignore u again for 20 minute until she come by with water and then bring the ice cream some of our party order . no food that the rest order . food come out so late that i need to have it bag in takeout container . just terrible . i don ' t know if they ' re just grossly understaffed or if the management doesn ' t care , but i ' d rather deal with disney bus and stay at a value resort .",0,281
"i think this hotel serve it ' s purpose . the best thing be that it be part of the airport . i imagine that one can just hop off a plane and within minute be check into their room and lay down for a much need nap . i didn ' t fly into orlando this time but stay here for a dance competition . this hotel have some nice amenity and be expansive . lot ' s of seat to rest and relax . room service food be delicious and prompt . the bed be comfy . the room be clean and updated . i be sit in the lobby and the table be kinda dirty . somebody have eat their lunch and leave some residue . i saw one of the cleaning lady . she come right over and take a cloth to it . very sweet . on the downside , the front desk staff be somewhat young and inexperienced and even a bit clueless . the noise in and around this hotel be distract but you be in the middle of an airport and the hotel have an open floor plan where you can see and hear down to the gate/ tsa level . noise be to be expect . you can hear noise from your room during the day especially if somebody be perform in the square but it seem to quiet down at night . they have lovely christmas decoration . i would stay at this hotel again if i have to or need something right at the airport . if not , i would prefer the grand hyatt closer to the park .",1,281
"we stay here for the last night of our 5 night vacation . the great thing about this hotel be that i be able to book it use 3 , 000 hyatt gold passport point 3 night before our stay here . con : it take me about 30 minute to check in because a guest before me book the hotel on the wrong night and be argue with the front receptionist . after wait in line , they finally have another person come to check- in folk . the gym be relatively small . it only have 1 treadmill , eliptical and bicycle . it look like these machine be all stuff in one tiny room with no common purpose . definitley not a place that would make me want to work out . pro : the room be very spacious and clean . i think the room they give me be a handicap room because it seem larger than usual , have a doorbell , and have safety rail surround the tub in the bathroom . the kitchen be fully equip with a small dishwasher , sink , good size fridge , microwave and 2 burner stove . if i be to cook that night i would be fully equip with all the need kitchen item . the hotel be also very close to the disneyworld attraction so the location be a plus . breakfast buffet be free and available from 7- 10. i would definetly recommend this for large family vacation to disneyworld or for folk that have 3 , 000 hyatt point and want a free night stay . oh yeah internet access be free : )",1,281
"although the hotel be cheap and the room be decent , not great because there be a huge cockroach in our room , i would not choose to stay there again . the complimentary shuttle suck ; they shuttle very few time during the day and night and they pick- up at 3- 4 different hotel and then you end up shuttle to the park you want to go to . for example , the epcot shuttle leave at 7 : 05am , they pick- up at 4 other hotel then you get to epcot and shuttle to magic kingdom - we didn ' t arrive at magic kingdom until 8 : 30am . the shuttle to universal studio didn ' t leave until after 9am ( after the park be already open ) . we end up rent a car after the 3rd day of this rat race . in addition , the free breakfast be awful and it be the same thing every day ( yuk ) . that , of course , didn ' t end up be completely free because they charge you for every additional person after 2 free and if you don ' t pay up front when you check in for the total amount of day they charge you more so we end up not eat all the day because it be the same food but be charge for all 8 day because we have to pre- pay . the staff be rude and unfriendly . the only one that actually help u be vanessa ; she be very sweet . i would not recommend this hotel ! ! ! ! ! !",0,280
"this be the creepiest and most dirty hotel i have ever stay in . the hall and room reek of funky smell . if i have to guess , the smell weren ' t just cigarette smoke . it be more like crack cocaine and crystal meth . the people we run into at the elevator be definitely high on something . their energy be scary . within five minute of be in our room , i kill five german roach . needle to say we didn ' t want to hang there . we go out to dinner and try to find another hotel . unfortunately all the hotel be book for the holiday . we head back to the hotel and we saw a pizza guy deliver . i say to him , what kind of place be this . all he say be i recommend you stay in your room late at night and the look on his face make it obvious that we be not in a safe hotel . we go to our room , cover the nasty couch with a sheet and stay awake , leave the light on and watch the tv a we look around u for roach non stop . i call the front office a place our complaint to a security guard . she say she know exactly what we say be true and that she would leave a note for the morning management to credit all of our money back . long story short . . . don ' t waste your money or time on this disgust unsafe hotel . there be absolutely nothing suite about it .",0,280
"i really can ' t understand how anyone could think this place be nice . the front desk staff be nice but the rest of the staff seem like the place be suck the life out of them . after 5 day there i felt the same ! the `` blanket '' on the bed be so thin it should just be a sheet ( it ' s actually sandwich between two sheet but it ' s such a bad joke ) . the conference food they serve be terrible . when the room above me flush their toilet . . . mine flush too ( many of my co- worker have the same freaky experience ) - which doesn ' t sound so bad until it flush at 1 : 30am and wake you up ! the vent in the bathroom have dust come out of it from not be clean . if you have to stay here i just feel bad for you . if you can stay somewhere else check into the hilton orlando on the next block a i do and you ' ll thank me later . pool and jacuzzi ' s be very basic , no real ambiance just a very sterile environment . the good be that the buffet at cafe gauguin be actually a good value and really do taste well and the wait staff in there be very helpful and friendly . the bar area be decent and intimate . the wifi be expensive if you only pay by the day but for extended stay it ' s only $ 25 for the length of your stay which be reasonable .",0,280
"oh my ! can i just say this place be amaze . . . . it so far exceeded my expectation ! we buy a groupon so that my best friend and i could take our daughter for my daughter 7th birthday to disney world . not that i think the place would be horrible but have purchase it on groupon at half price i be a little skeptical and definitely didn ' t expect it to be a nice a it be . the ground ( pool , park , landscaping , etc ) be stun . the condo itself be unbelievable ! we walk in and it have a really nice living/ din room area , small kitchen ( perfect for vacation ) , really nice flat screen tv , 2 full bathroom , amaze shower and best of all 2 room one with a king size bed and the other with 2 queen . wow i expect a full in one room and a queen in the other at best : ) this be awesome . also it ' s really easy to find , right off the freeway and only a short drive from disney . housekeeping be great , i wish they ' d come to my house ! lastly we be close to thing like target , publix and cv ( which come in handy when we have the 3 year old get sick at 2am ) ! wow , i be so excited to write a review . it ' s always nice to give someone credit when/ where credit be due . bravo it ' s definitely due here : )",1,279
"book travel to orlando the * day before we left* through and they recommend this hie with 3 . 9 star . for a hotel we book for cross- country travel with almost no research it be a good find . the hie be a clean , decent hotel overall and within walk distance of universal ( although there ' s a free shuttle that run in the morning if you book it ahead of time ) . after read about the lack of tub in most room we request one with and get a handicap accessible room , which be fine . the `` seal '' on the tub to keep water in be a bit rusted but otherwise it be immaculate . nice bed , run a/ c and a flat screen . good , complimentary hot breakfast in the morning although it lean heavily toward greasy and starchy . after two day of cinnamon bun and sausage i discover the cereal hidden in the back corner and stuck with raisin bran for the rest of the week . there ' s skim milk , light and fit yogurt , and bananas too but it ' s worth note the banana be the only fresh fruit they offer . the coffee be surprisingly good and i ' d encourage you not to pass it up for a trip to starbucks across the block . next time i travel to orlando i ' m probably go to try and stay on- site at a park but if you ' re look for an affordable alternative the hie next to universal be a good place to stay at .",1,279
"we stay here in orlando in our visit to universal studio . we be very disappointed in the size of the room a the family suite have a king size bed that take up the entire area of the sleeping room for parent and the kid area have a bunk bed both twin size with a trundle bed to pull out . the area be just over the wall from a room divider wall and not actually 2 separate room . this be very disappointing and the 2 tv be able to be hear at low volume so you couldn ' t even watch 2 separate show . the breakfast on the other hand be very good with it ' offering , but very crowd . they provide all the necessary item except soda on which i purchase from the front desk for $ 3 . 50 a bottle . . . outrageous really ! the 20 fl . oz bottle serf 1 person and i spend $ 3 . 50 ridiculous ! ! ! i will not stay here again simply because they charge for everything even park at $ 8 . 00. this area have so many hotel and resort that offer free parking and more of a kitchen area that with family you can do much better then this . we have enjoy other resort at a similar rate in many previous visit but just think we would try the fairfield inn & amp ; suite but disappointed overall . the hotel be locate right next to highway 4 and congestion and noisy always . choose another place to stay in lake buena vista orlando .",0,279

"i be disappoint here , though i do not know what to compare it to locally . it be expensive to use wifi in the room- $ 2 . 75 for fifteen minute . it be free in the lobby but that be inconvenient . parking be $ 12 per day extra . re- concierge- they now have no concierge , just a booth that say `` universal concierge '' . my experience there be terrible- one woman be very rude and say she can only get ticket for universal and be le than helpful regard any other question ; and the second person at the `` universal concierge '' desk be a man whom i ask about magic kingdom ticket and he immediately pull out a form pressure me to sign up for a `` condo '' talk for ninety minute which would give me half price ticket . that be all he want to talk about . i be angry that a fancy hotel would not have their own neutral concierge . the place felt anonymous , almost robot- like staff ; the pool be nice and room be fine ; would be just terrific to have option of microwave in room along with frig for those of u with family and want to avoid expensive cost for food . it basically feel blah . there be pleasant chair in lobby for wifi , reading and relaxation which be nice for family . most upsetting be the deceptive role of suppose `` concierge '' and lack of a true hotel concierge in a tourist town like this .",1,270
"nice location off by itself . this hotel be locate in a cluster of upscale hotel on the golf course that be set a bit off to themselves . there be a path that run along the golf course that be refresh to walk along . the hilton bonnet creek and waldorf astoria be actually connect by an indoor walkway and share restaurant and lounge . the staff be friendly and helpful throughout the hotel , but probably due to the economy they be way understaffed in the restaurant . the room be nice although the closet be rather small . the pool area be very pleasant and have several bridge cross it and a lazy river for float around the curling loop . the pool bar have great outdoor seating by gas fire pit that make for a terrific meeting spot . you can be under cover or in the open air which be pleasant most time of the year . the lobby bar be a social gathering place so sometimes be very loud , but there be a small amount of outdoor seat on the balcony that be very pleasant allow you to be outside and enjoy the fresh air . the business center be very helpful and man - i make use of it while i be there and be very pleased . this be the third time i have stay here for business and i will return . i highly recommend take the walk way to the waldorf loung , bull and bear , if you want a quiet spot away from the crowd .",1,269
"great location . close to disney and other related attraction . lobby be spacious with a variety of din option . i use room service each night and the staff be great . my biggest complaint about this hotel be with maintenance and housekeeping . i don ' t think they really have kid in mind when they build this hotel . the lock be low enough for a young inquisitive kid to open it and potentially walk out . not only be this scary , but a serious safety issue . when the maintenance man saw this , he agree and say he be go to get his manager to look into it . that be the last we saw and heard from maintenence . no one follow up . whoever do the laundry either doesn ' t pay attention to detail or they ' re just work with shoddy equipment . there be excess hair and stain on the sheet , pillow , washcloth and towel . they be so bad , that the staff who clean the room , be change them excessively and take picture at the same time . they be nice to u about it , but you can tell they be frustrate and reasonably so . hopefully housekeep can quickly get it together with this . no one want to wash or sleep in someone else ' s hair or stain . the pool be nice . all in all , it ' s not the best hotel but it ' s not too bad for just a couple of day .",1,269

i personally prefer go to the portifino due to the fact that the hard rock be very dirty on weekend with large crowd and sometimes the worker don ' t seem to into their job so it seem they don ' t care . the unlimited quick q be very good for busy day or else you may be wait in longer line than the regular line . also the only popular ride it doesn ' t work for be harry potter ( the castle one ) . it even apply to some show . the whole deal with hear music under the pool wasn ' t execute well the only way to hear it even enough for it to be good be to put your ear up to the speaker . the water slide be definitely fun but a alway at this hotel it have a huge crowd ( normally ) and then you be freeze . some good family program do exist but i wouldn ' t suggest drop your child off thee while you go to the park you should bring your child along if you go to the park . the walk distance be a good 5 minute walk into the park or take a water taxi right out your hotel . the work out room facility do cost money . 10 dollar for a day ! ! ! not that good for family but ok for certain people if you like hard rock hotel you will like this but it be by far he worst on universal property,0,263

"really disappointed with our stay here . while the room be lovely and customer service fantastic , they fell very short in other area that you wouldn ' t expect from an omni . we constantly hear noisy child run the hallway . we order room service but it take extra long because they didn ' t have a readily available gluten- free menu . they didn ' t disclose that parking be not include in the stay when we book our room . and when i take time to write to management about our experience , they have nothing more to offer than thank you for my time ! very shocked overall - the price you pay be not worth a poor experience ! in regard to kelly ' s response : omni should consider ensure omni standard be effectively communicate through third party company who offer room . in regard to the gf menu ; obviously i request this , and be tell over the phone they ' d have to call me back - that they do not have a gf menu . while i understand these be minor issue , it ' s the poor customer service i ' ve since receive that have put such a bad taste in my mouth . bottom line : customer and client want to know they have be hear , and omni have do nothing but argue to protect their brand rather than make thing right with their `` value '' patron .",0,254
"awful shuttle service . do not expect this place to be convenient , especially if you be in a hurry for meeting or airport . not only do you have to stand outside in the terrible temperature for at least 40 minute just to get to the lobby ( even though they say they will be there in 10- 15minutes ) but the service be rude and they act like we owe them something . room be completely spread out from the lobby , no food at night , and you can ' t call a taxi to come pick you up from your room . not allow per resort rule . so basically you have to take a shuttle to the lobby in order to then get a taxi . also , there be an awful stench in the room ( lot of smoke mask by very cheap cleaning spray ) and when complain , management proudly respond that it be the `` sheraton scent. `` the curtain , the carpet , the dishes- really dirty . and to make matter worse , there be a real live frog in the room . despite initial complaint , the hotel do nothing . after a few more call , they finally agree to move u to another room . lastly , instead of focus on customer service , they keep call the room harassing you for a timeshare . ridiculous . do not recommend this place at all . avoid avoid avoid .",0,253

worst hotel ever . the only that make this place somewhat tolerable be the bed be decent at best and there be bus transportation to all the park below which by the way also suck if you do not have a car since the bus have to make a million stop prior to where you need to be . but it be convenient for the most part . the room at the dolphin be totally outdated and grungy just like the bathroom and they have old school box tv ' s. that should be a summary of how the room be . the house keeper be rude a hell and barely do there job enough to where my parent get a credit for 50 for mess up a bad a they do . this hotel be not only run by rude and creepy staff but the food at that picabu place be absolutely disgust . from the egg breakfast to the wannabe stingy chipotle where they only fill your plate with a half scoop of everything for 10+ dollar . next thing be the dolphin like to freeze it visitor to below zero temperature to where my brother get sick because of the huge temp drop he would endure from go outside to sticky muggy orlando weather to the north pole climate indoors . a you can see there be way too many thing i can go on about this place will also leave this short and simple .,0,249
"so against my better judgement my family convince me to stay here again . i be resign to not complain again , but during my stay hilton texted me to see how i would rate my stay . when i respond poorly they pledge to call me to discuss . the only call i receive be to try and sell me a time share . a synopsis of this stay : 1. receive a room configuration that i do not book2 . credit card charge $ 1300 too much 3. i be lock out of room due to key not work and be not allow back into my room , because it be my wife who have check in and she be out shopping . so myself and 2 young child , who i have take to pool , be out of luck . 4. elevator constantly get stick with people in them . 5. construction next to hotel begin at 6 : 30 be and be loud . 6. pipe leak in my parent room on first floor damage their stuff . on the bright side the room be nice enough . but you can find `` nice enough '' anywhere in the orlando area . this hotel need to step up customer service , hire logical people , and keep the resort maintenance wise . also , call guest with problem back when you solicit them would be professional a well . go elsewhere ! ! !",0,249
". we go up to orlando for a friend wedding and a member of our group book this hotel through hotwire . we pick it solely for the purpose of ease a well need to be cheaper than the disney resort . we get a 2 bedroom suite to split for me and my bf plus my friend and her husband for only 130/ night . i didn ' t really check out any amenity before get there so a we be close by and in a residential area i be grow a little concerned . a we pull up to the resort it be like the cloudy sky open and then sun shone down right on the resort . the resort be keep beautifully and the staff at checkin be friendly . we get up to the room and it be hugeeeeee . it have a full kitchen a table that u could seat 8 , two bedroom and two bath . one bed room have double bed and a smaller bath , the other bedroom `` the master bedroom '' have a huge king bed and a bathroom that you ' d kill for . it have a jacuzzi tub , seperate stand shower and two sink . it also have a back balcony and a back exit . only issue be the resort have no restaurant or bar on- site . so if you like a cold one at the pool prepare to byob !",1,248
"on the opposite side of panera at lake eola , lie the entrance to the eo hotel and spa . it ' s a posh little inn with a full- service beauty spa to boot . and boy be it heavenly . their rate be very reasonable and if you happen to catch them on the right day , you might find there to be a discount . for instance , last saturday instead of a 50 minute massage be $ 70 , it be only $ 60. the european massage be what i enjoy and it be $ 75 which coincides with most other spa , from my experience . but it be well worth it . the facial expert be kind and take great pride in her work . not to mention the effort she put into make me feel comfortable and happy throughout our 50 minute . i enjoy a good mix of steaming , mask , and a face and hand massage . i would have no qualm about recommend this business to anyone . except those that don ' t want to completely relax and be transport away to relaxationland . and if you know a special female who really need a pick- me- up , check out their `` queen for a day '' package- - she would receive a facial , full body massage , 1/ 2 hour body care treatment and a manicure and pedicure . amaze right ? ?",1,248

"a nice mix of disney and non- disney . for the price of stay in a higher end hotel on the disney property , swan and dolphin be actually a solid value . that be say , you be not actually stay in a disney property . this can be see in some of the detail . while disney definitely overcharge to stay on property , little thing like park be include . this hotel charge you $ 18 to park . they do offer the disney shuttle and boat service to the park which be nice , but do not surround you with disney theme and flair . the room be nice and clean , and the property definitely have an upper- class feel to it . there be larger fountain , nice bar , and little coffee shop tuck throughout the property . the pool area be very well do , with water slide , rock wall , and hot tub . they even have outdoor ping pong . if you want to save a bit on the room charge and don ' t mind be nickel and dim while you escape the mouse , this be your place . if you be look to be surround by all thing disney , you may want to look elsewhere . you would not know this be a disney hotel if it be not within the confines of the park .",1,241

"for the review that i read i have to say i be expect this place to be a little better than it be . yes the picture look nice , and yes the hotel be nice , but it all felt a little plain for a hilton . the one thing i do like be the service . for some reason they have lose my reservation do check in do take longer than i would have hope , but the lady that i have seem to deal with it well and a fast a she could which be very appreciated after a long day . the room be so so . i mean for upwards of $ 200 a night i would expect it to be a little nicer . the bathroom be pretty small , and i ' ve see bigger shower . the tv be a good size but some of the hd cable channel come out all blurry . despite the dislike the room be very clean and the bed be very soft . all in all i definitely wouldn ' t give this place anything lower than 3 star , but 4 star seem just a little much for what you get . i think i ' ll try another one of the many hotel around this area next time , but i ' ll keep tho one in my list just on case .",1,239

"we have find our hotel `` home away from home '' that be perfect for our family for our disney trip . what close the deal for u be the suite with two separate bedroms . do yourself a favor , spend the few extra buck and get one if you have kid . let ' s be honest , what couple in their thirty really want to go to bed the same time a a three year old ? with the separate bedroom , parent be free to talk , watch a movie , grab a cocktail , or even to grab each other if it suit their fancy . any shenanigan be then follow by peaceful sleep gloriously devoid of kid interruption . . . . ahhhh yes , the comfort and privacy of that room be worth it weight in gold . hotel itself could use some spruce up , although the pool area be spacious and fun for kid . the breakfast be typical hotel fare , but present nicely , and it get you out the door quickly . so much saving over the disney name property , i don ' t see how this isn ' t a no- brainer .",1,207
"for the week we stay in orlando , my family take to call this place the `` serra- stinko '' . we check in and go to our room , and man , be this place dirty ! very unclean . moldy , debris behind the pull- down bed , sheet be dirty , etc . i kid you not , all the mattress in the room be spring with cloth pull over them . no way i could sleep on that . the wireless interenet be down , and so i have to drive around town to find another place to stay that night . the `` free shuttle '' be run by an outside company , so if the shuttle get full , too bad , find another way to disneyworld . the holiday inn across the street have update room , be clean and be le cost than the serralago . the only good thing i have to say about the serralago be when we check out 2 hour after we check in , they do not charge u for the room that night . that be nice of them , and why i give them 2 star instead of just one .",0,206
"love the hotel and staff . unlike other comment , we do appreciate the lack of a disney theme . we be a group of 3 couple that have be friend for 20 + year - we do enjoy the ability to de- disney while at the hotel . we find the shuttle service to the transportation center and other location extremely efficient and easy to use . really , really dislike the restaurant option . we pay for the breakfast package and but be not able to use it . the breakfast be suppose to be buffet and we be turn away 2x due to a 15- 20 minute wait in a 1/ 3 full restaurant . we be able to get a refund for the breakfast portion of our bill . the starbucks kiosk in the lobby be greatly appreciate but severely understaffed . mangino ' s - i ' m not sure what to say . we be a party of 4 adult - the salmon be delicious , the chicken marsala be passable but the pizza be awful and obviously a frozen and reheated product . we will be back but please upgrade the dining option to meet with disney standard .",1,206
"they do not have my room that i reserve on their website when i arrive . they give me another room which be a downgrade and basically offer it to me a if i ' d didn ' t matter . i have no choice but to stay a i fly in that night and have no choice a all surround hotel be full due to a convention . then the maid would come by everyday regardless of the do not disturb sign to clean and give towel . she say she doesn ' t get pay unless she clean . when she knock on the door very quietly i do not have enough time to make it to the door to keep her out , this be regardless of me yell that i do t need cleaning . she basically be try to push in and look in the room . i shut the door on her and chain it . i would never stay here again . it be terrible . with all the other hotel around , i would highly recommend find somewhere else . also the room do not smell very pleasant . oh , and the wifi connection be terrible .",0,206

"this hyatt be a really nice , truly enormous hotel in spit distance of orlando ' s convention center . i attend a multi- day business meeting here and be please with my comfortable and luxuriously appoint room . i be disappoint that some small amenity be miss from my room . there be no remote for the television build into my bathroom mirror , so i wasn ' t able to use it ( please , no need to weep for me . i overcome this significant hardship , somehow. ) . there be also no room service menu , which mean that i order `` some kind of chicken sandwich thing if you have it '' and probably didn ' t optimize my option . room service do not supply me with a room service menu , either , even though i mention the lack of one . again , please dry your tear . these small oversight aside , i think the hotel be lovely and the staff universally helpful . i also appreciate that it be possible to run in the hotel ' s neighborhood , which be not always the case in orlando . i ' d stay here again .",1,206
"i ' m on the planning committee for my company , and we just hold our conference here for the first time . the planning process be simple . our guest have be very impressed with the change to this location . this be a small boutique hotel , and we host a small conference with 100 attendee . here we ' re the big fish in a small pond instead of the small fish in a big pond like most conference center . we hold a private dinner for 22 people in the hamilton ' s kitchen in the hotel . everyone rave about the food and the service . i have a gluten allergy and have be completely spoil by the attentiveness from the server in the restaurant and the conference center . the hotel be a short 2 block from park avenue , so we be able to walk to dinner for a change of scenery . the hotel be dog friendly , but i have yet to hear a dog bark . i could not be more pleased with the conference a a whole . this have be a wonderful experience , and we plan to book again for next year .",1,206
"recently spend a night at this hotel while pass through orlando . i be a well experience traveler who have stay at many hotel around the nation and internationally . i have also stay at embassy suite many time in the past include this particular property . i have to say i be le than impress at this property , which i find to be show it age and not age very gracefuly i may add . i find the hotel to be old , and worn look and this be shock to me because embassy usually keep their hotel look top notch . while the bed be comfortable and the morning breakfast , which be traditional for embassy , be just ok. i just find the hotel lacking in appearance . staff be very hospitable however . the first room we be assign too be near elevator and smelt moldy , we be quickly reassign to a better location and second room do not have a foul odor . i think the property on jamaican court be much more up to par with embassy standard and what you would expect but ultimately not a bad second choice here if the price be fare .",0,205

compulsory resort fee of $ 18/ day seem a ripoff since it hide the true day fee you see when do a search with company like orbitz or i would have rat 4 star if there be no resort fee . i didn ' t realise it be an addon until i arrive . they charge it to u when we check out . the resort fee seem to be a florida thing and be different with each hotel . we have to take taxi everywhere . meers run a shuttle service but it doesn ' t come to our hotel . watch out for the private black taxi . they seem to be about 5- 15 $ more than the regular taxi . and if you don ' t specify the type of taxi you want at the front door you seem to get them . we find meers and black diamond taxi to be cheaper . i have no other complaint about this hotel . service be everything you ' d expect . the shower be awesome . it have 2 shower head . i suspect we get a room for disabled people since there be arm bar everywhere along the wall .,1,205

"bed bug , dirty , uncomfortable , and terrible service . this be the absolute worst hotel experience of my life . i wish i be exaggerate . 4/ 4 people who stay in our room go home with bed bug . the water would take 30 minute to warm up , even if someone have just get out of the shower , regardless of time of day . when the room would get clean , they would take all of the towel , but do not replace them . when we call to ask for more towel , it take 3 phone call and over an hour to get replacement . this occur on two occasion . the light in the bathroom do not work the first night there , despite request to have it fix . the staff be rude whenever a request be make . not like we be ask for extravagant thing , like light in the room . we have bill issue a well ; include double charge for a cot . the carpet have clearly not be clean in the last 15 year . oh , do i mention the bed bug ? stay at your own risk .",0,205
"at first i think it be ok because it be so cheap , even though the hot tub smell like old indian food and dog spit , and a dirty diaper litter the pool area that i toss , then the guy at the front desk tell me the maid need to come clean my room because i be keep it dirty . i have one small bag with me , and again i be clean a could be . but it an unfortunate theme that god want to humiliate me that way . the maid be just in the room when i be in it and clean without a peep , smile and perfectly fine i think , then all of a sudden it be an embarrassing issue from a hotel that have mostly complaint about it cleanliness . if anything i ' m sure i make it smell better but i be so upset they do that to me i will never forget it . this be a while ago , apparently it still lame but i want to make a statement . it be unnecessary to be treat that way a it be a lie and i pay to stay there .",0,205

"a five star experience if you do it right . disney provide exceptional customer service . the work of creative people from every discipline be on display everywhere you look . it ' s impossible to see everything in one visit , there ' s too much to do . my childhood memory of the magic kingdom and especially epcot center be brand on my mind , i ' m a customer for life . i have a fantastic time on my last trip . i visit all four park , but i didn ' t do the waterparks or downtown disney . it be september and it wasn ' t crowd except for epcot because the food and wine festival be go on . food and wine be a fun surprise , i didn ' t know that be a thing . hollywood studio be my favorite park , i love star tour and fantasmic be a great show . it ' s important to get to the park early . i be at the gate of the magic kingdom when they open and manage to ride most of the really popular attraction before lunch . good time if you like fun .",1,204

"my company ' s hq be in orlando and have a rate with this hotel so i ' ve be about ten time over the last two year . . pros- staff be nice , place be clean , starbucks in lobby , decent view , nice gym area . not bad for a one night staycons - this hotel have by far the worst food of any hotel i ' ve ever be to room service or breakfast buffet . even something simple like a burger be just plain bad . constant wifi problem with the screen never come up ( probably half the time i ' ve be ) in the room so don ' t plan on get work do , train pass by loudly at all hour of the night , shuttle be always 20 minute away somehow even though it ' s only suppose to travel 3 mile and get a cab here be just a difficult so make sure you give plenty of time if you have a meetingadvice to management - get some new cook , fix your wifi issue , add a couple more shuttle and you ' d be rank much higher",0,201
"the fairway villa be awesome . the be 2 bedroom unit with 2 bath , a living room area , large din area with seat for 8 , nice kitchen with dishwasher , screen private porch and washer/ dryer in the utility room . the master bath also have a jacuzzi tub which be a nice relaxing treat . a others have say - there be 2 beautiful golf course in the adjoin seaview property with a well appoint hotel . we usually stay at the hotel which use to be own by marriott too but be now own by stockton college but i really enjoy the villa this time because it give me some option while i wait for hubby to finish golfing . we didn ' t do any activity but there be plenty available - instead we go to the casino which be only about 15 minute away . be sure to check out the nature trail behind the villa which wrap through the wood for 1 . 1 mile around a few hole on the golf course bits a nice walk . definitely will try this again - much better than a casino or seaview hotel .",1,201
"get a great deal from a discount site , but would have be very angry if i have to pay full price . room be date and loud . plumbing and hall a well a neighbor in next room could be hear at all hour . bed not very comfortable and no wi- fi offer in room ! ! ! ? ? ? it ' s across the street from a convention center and it ' s 2011 ! ridiculous ! red deli be open 24 hour and have a great selection of food , snack and sundries . it ' s the best feature of the hotel . 89forty offer some interesting item and be good enough . don ' t bother with banshoo sushi . what a let down . item look great on paper ( menu ) but completely fail to impress in presentation and taste . gaugin be mediocre at best . didn ' t try everglades but menu look like a winner . staff be mostly friendly and helpful . would not return unless a major remodel take place and if they be to offer wi- fi in room . it ' s 2011 people !",0,201

this place be really really bad . the reason why i get this place be because we could not find any other place a it be christmas season . this hotel lie to me by tell my wife that only 2 room be leave . first lie . this place be empty . the bed be very hard but that be something that anyone can have different opinion . but the worse be the restroom just flood even if you only go to make # 1 . so take your imagination from there . i have to take my kid to the restaurant . and after te second night when i be shower my kid i have no hot water . i call the front office they tell me they have no explanation for that and they didn ' t know when it will be fix . so my wife and daughter have to take cold shower at 11 : pm . and not enough say when you come i ' m you smell the old carpet . i be a buisness owner and i hate bad review . so this be how bad experiment i have here .,0,199
"i rarely yelp about hotel but this one . not only do they not have wireless available in their room but the wireless in the lobby be $ 4 . 95/ hr and then they charge me for an hour i didn ' t even use . also , the first hour i use about 35 minute , press stop where indicate and when i return my minute be go . work be pay but it be the principle of the thing . also , this place be pricy for what it be . you would think you be at the ritz in nyc for goodness sake . lobby be way too cold , hallway be freeze ! room be average a best , tv be a mess and have few channel and the menu of the channel be not always right ! food be very average at best and expensive . do i say expensive ! the only good thing be the pool and that it be across the street from the convention center . nothing else be impressive at all . if you stay , stay for convenience to convention center and or nice big pool !",0,199

"the front desk print my park ticket and plane ticket ( since i lose all of them in the cab ride ) . also , employee be quick to ask me if i could be help ( a i frequently have a confused look on my face haha ) but most importantly , on the cab ride to the airport i realize that i lose $ 150 . 00 - i call the caribe immediately , an employee find it in the room ( along with a dress i forget ) and security will be ship my belonging fedex this week . it take all of 20 minute for this process to happen . i have hear story of traveler lost/ forgotten item ' miraculously disappear ' so i be very grateful for the honesty of the caribe . so , the water pressure wasn ' t the best , our shower somehow leave big puddle on the floor , and i question how much alcohol actually be not in the pool bar ' s drink , but hey . . . can ' t beat kindness and honesty .",1,190
"good : the location be nice . lot of restaurant and shop around , like 7- eleven , pizza hut , burger king . . . the hotel provide free shuttle bus to disney park and you can ask hotel for the schedule table . there be also a free bus to vineland premium outlet which i think be operate by tommy hilfiger . this will pick up at 1115 and back at 1530 and 1730 but not available in sunday . if you choose `` go green '' , which mean waive the room service , you can get a $ 5 voucher everyday . someone say it only can be use for unalcohol beverage but i use two get a cheese cake . bad : there be a resort fee $ 20 per day though i don ' t understand what it be . there be no free shuttle bus to universal studio so i have to use uber . but only $ 10 to there . if you be first time to use it , get a free ride use the promo code `` yuzhelue '' .",1,190
"do . not . stay . here . there be upcharges for * everything* . housekeeping be lovely , but front desk be not , much a other review say . and the bell staff say they be too busy to help u , but you can ' t really unload your item yourself in the middle of the street , which be the only option for check- in . breakfast price rival disney ' s character breakfast , with none of the ambiance . the room snack be on an open tray , with no option to move or hide the 7 dollar water . if the pressure- sensitive tray be even jostle , you get charge for the item . the refrigerator be full of drink , and not available for use . room be acceptable , but not special . bathroom be like grandma ' s house . once nice , now just date . oh ! and if they make you upgrade to a pool view on the 20th floor , you can hear the booming music and yelling of the dj at nap time .",0,190
"cry baby all night and all morning ? check . next door neighbor inch from you ? check ! $ 30 breakfast and $ 25 nightly resort fee ? check ! on the bright side , our room be clean and staff be nice . the pool be sweet because they ' re open 24 hour , but a a single lady who be try to spend a little time with her man that also mean kid up 24/ 7 cannon- balling water all over me . the bed be fantastic , and there ' s a convenience shop downstairs which be nice . all in all , if you ' re look for a relaxing guest orient experience splurge a little more and choose a different place . if you ' re look for a cheap , simple , and close option with disney shuttle , stay here . the only reason it isn ' t get four star be because the room be way too close to each other , and they charge and arm and a leg for a resort fee yet do not provide breakfast .",0,190
"i stay at the dolphin resort because of it proximity to epcot and hollywood studio . i really like the disney transportation to all of the disney park and the free package delivery system if you buy thing at the park . it ' s nice not to worry about package when you ' re roam around the park and go on ride . you can also buy the disney park ticket in guest service here . the room itself be ok. the bed be comfortable , there be cable tv , you get bottle of water , there be a mini fridge , and the view be great . i be able to see both epcot and hollywood studio from my room . however , the bathroom need update . the tile and countertop look very old . also , the shower take a long time to drain . bottom line : it ' s not a bad hotel . there be a lot of good perk , but the room need to be modernize . i also wish there be transportation to and from the airport .",1,189
"stay here when we go to orlando for universal ( wizarding world of harry potter- you must go ! ) we have a few requirement & amp ; they meet them all : - close to the park ( $ 6 taxi ride ) - good pool & amp ; hot tub for the kid ( great ! ! ! ! ) - gym ( small but get the job do ) - affordable but not gross- part of the universal partner program that get you into harry potter an hour early ( do this- trust me- so worth it ) the room be basic- clean & amp ; functional . definitely a 1990s vibe , but whatever , we spend little time in our room . the deli & amp ; restaurant be kind of grody look with pretty much zero option for vegan ( even the fruit cup have yogurt throw on top- wtf ? ) , we eat every meal out . would definitely stay again . it ' s great for family on a budget who aren ' t look for lot of frill .",0,189

"so , i need a place for my family to go for a night while we visit some relative in orlando . i think why not make it a nice place a oppose to a regular hotel . the word `` resort '' in the title be mislead . we book a family room with bunk bed . the bathroom be so small the door hit the toilet when you open it . our room open to the outside , there be no central air and the floor be make of very cheap `` hardwood- look '' material . i have to plug the cable into the tv because it be not when we arrive . check in take forever ( an hour after their check in begin ) . i still have to go to the front desk to check out the next day . there be also a bug greet me in the middle of the night when i have to go to the bathroom . if you be truly look for a resort , keep look .",0,180

this be a terrible deal - and only get a one because it be close to epcot . my room phone didn ' t work and i ask to have it fix ( no ) . ask to have someone show u how to use the fold out couch - no one come . dirty dish from prior guest outside out door ( on outside chair ) our entire stay . program our band wrong so i couldn ' t get back in my room . stop twice by concierge and get bad advice - once tell just take wrist band for mini golf and when we walk to next resort be tell we need a coupon . when we check in no one help with our bag . we stand in one line and be tell we need to walk all this way to a different checkin and the guy take off and we drag our bag through the hotel up several floor and then later back down and down stair even to our room . awful !,0,179
"here be an excellent suite hotel just down the road from epcot . the seven- story hotel have moderately price room with comfortable bed and good pull- out sofa bed . more important it serve a free large buffet and have a steakhouse that be open to 11 pm . after a too early meal at wdw , we decide to eat at the bistro . the steak melt in your mouth and the salmon be good . there ' s a decent wine menu . it be a saturday night but the place be not very busy except for a huge take- out business which include much of the menu . a note by an earlier writer , we use a discount from and since we live in tampa and have annual pass , we do not use the shuttle . we do see some people use transportation to go to a nearby discount mall . for the price and location and the service , buena vista suit beat similar hotel ten minute off the disney property .",1,179
"i be at the dolphin for a convention and be not pleased . the food be awful and service mediocre to say the least . if you don ' t have kid with you , disney doesn ' t care . there be only 1 bar ( if you can call it that ) and the cabana by the pool be suppose to be open until 10 pm but be close by 8 pm every night we be there . the room be not worth the price ! this hotel need to be update and bring into this century ! it be amaze that be one of the key note speaker be from disney talk about their award win service . i didn ' t experience any award win service ! to top off our stay be our luggage be store outside while we attend our last class . it be 90 degree outside and the $ 30 of chocolate i be bring home to my family be a melted ball of goo in 100 individually wrapped piece .",0,179
"disney be the most magical place in the world for kid ! pet the best childhood memory . but be prepare : stroller for young onesrain coat . no rain shelter so it get pretty crowded snack , not a large variety of food or seat areafast pas work great , but the timing can be limit which will scatter you throughout the park , which mean more walking . my best advice be to go to reach area and then to the next , no back and forth . my only bad experience that really upset me be , the character be so hard to take a photo with , line be so long , and rarely an option to catch . i didn ' t take any photo with character , my child do with mickey which be by the theater and last 10 second . inside the park some employee be not helpful , we experience about 3 unhelpful incident . love disney , good luck , next time we go well be a while !",1,179
"clean- ish . greet by a gate , but it didn ' t make you feel safe . check in be silent and awkward . i ' m glad we didn ' t pay much to stay there . no amenity , and the burner in the kitchen didn ' t work . there ' s only a shower , no tub . very old tv . definitely no soundproof room there . lola man star me down while he hump his girlfriend on the back of her car . no lie . creepy and gross . it be like walk into a time warp . i ' ll definitely not go back . the man hump his gf make me concerned for my safety too , in a rapist kind of way . what the hell ? pay the $ 15+ dollar more a night through priceline or wherever and get a better place . i also leave an expensive jacket there . cost more than 2 night there . too bad for me , all around .",0,179
"the hotel seem nice , i haven ' t stay there but i go to the bar for happy hour friday 7- 10 pm . the service be horrible , the waitress have very bad attitude , not friendly , the food be really disappointing , i order meatball which be okay but cold , mac and cheese be horrible , cabrese salad be okay but you can make it better at home , happy hour never again unless you be go there for a drink . i go with a group for brunch , the say we don ' t serve alcohol before 11 be ! ! ! ! ! to be fair , ambience be super nice , i would still go there for a drink or brunch `` after 11 '' they should hire someone to teach their staff to be more friendly and make that beautiful place a popular destination for local a well a hotel resident . they should learn from the ritz in orlando . this place have a great potential though .",0,179

"what a horrific experience with the spa . i call from out of town to make a reservation for a guest . it be gift , which i say explicity , and give them my credit card number and authorize a 20 % tip . any decent spa around the country could pull this transaction off . . . but not the peabody . instead , they give me a courtesy call 24 hour before . . . i be at a football game , so i couldn ' t hear anything and hung up . no return call the next day for the appointment , so i figure everything be fine . instead , they force the guest i make the appointment for pay in full . never once be i inform that the call the day before be to reauthorize ( which seem totally pointless ) and even if that be policy , surely a call at the time of payment would be appropriate . what a joke . stay away .",0,174
i ' ve be try to cut back on my business travel expense so instead of best western i ' m stay in motel . but if i have to put up with garbage place like this i will gladly pay the extra cost for a decent room . my refrigerator didn ' t work so i go to get ice . the ice machine be empty . i be direct to a second ice machine a good distance away and it be also empty . no ice in a motel ? wow . the clerk say it be because guest fill up ice chest but it look more like the capacity be too small for the size of the place . you ' d think the owner would just buy bigger ice machine . or refrigerator that work . while they ' re at it they can get pillow that you can actually sleep on . the one they have aren ' t good for anything . stay away from this rathole .,0,174

"this be one of disney ' s deluxe resort that i like . it ' s locate in the epcot resort section and share it border with the beach club and board walk resort . the hotel be for more of any older crowd without child . the decor be more of a boat decor with wood wainscoting throughout the hotel . the room be recently renovate so they be nice and clean . the one big draw be that you get to use the stormalong bay pool which be share with the beach club . this pool be like a little water park . it have an awesome pirate boat slide , and lazy river , and the pool be line with beach sand on the bottom . the pool be only for guest that stay at yacht club or beach club . this resort have a very calm atmosphere and it be really close to hollywood studio and epcot . i recommend this hotel if you want a relaxing atmosphere .",1,173
"have to stay here a part of an all inclusive deal . lesson learn . go into it very optimistic but leave disappointed . obviously orlando be disney town and most people be okay sacrifice quality for a place close to the park . obviously the ownership know this because there be very little incentive to make the hotel competitive . this place look like it hasn ' t be renovate or clean in 20 year . the furniture be paint brown , chip everywhere . bed squeak . the ac make sound like a cat be step on every time it would shut off . pillow be dirty . everything be dusty and beat up . the hallway carpet be wear to thread . door don ' t shut firmly , gap everywhere . very low quality vibe overall . thankfully we only use this place to sleep during the two day we be in orlando . think of this place a a a last resort , no pun intend .",0,172
"check in late on thursday evening and stay 4 night . night clerk be miserable . haven ' t be to a more sour- staffed hotel ever . valet , concierge , hotel desk staff all look very unhappy and nobody greets you when you come in . it ' s a though you be inconvenience them with your presence . i expect more from a hilton property and certainly more from one so close to disney and associate with disney by the presence of a disney store onsite . first room they give u be a hilton honor room which be infest with ant . second room have a strange machine run which we later learn be to remove smell . the maintenance and security personnel be the only happy hilton face we saw all weekend . the room be surface clean but don ' t check the corner . pretty sure the slide door between room have a butt print on them . win ' t be come back .",0,172
"after my last review , their service suddenly gotten much better . twice a day housekeeping , valet be very helpful . . . . pool staff also set up the towel for u when we get there . it almost get to the right level . . . . it wasn ' t perfect , but improve . i would ' ve give 4 star for the effort , but after my last review , one of my charger disappear from the wall . . . we look everywhere , and no luck . . . . win ' t accuse anybody , but just odd it happen after the review be up . . . . hmmmm . . . . from my experience , hotel can be spectacular just from the architecture and location stand point only . but 4 star can sometimes have that also . 5 star set itself apart , make you pay hundred more , because of the service . another example terranea resort .",1,172
"will leave 3 star simply because of accommodation . very quick : we stay in building 16 , room 505 and 506 ( big fam ) . 1. first and foremost the worst internet connection ever ; 2. toilet at 506 have to be flush several time for $ ! ! t to go down ; 3. roach at 506 kitchen ; 4. kitchen ware be so cheap like they get it at a dollar store ; 5. outlet cover be weak , actually come out from their place when i be just charge my phone ; 6. customer service not responsive , have to call three time for them to come over to clean the place ; ideally i would want to see bigger pool but at this point it be what it be . not much stuff to do for kid . just one fun pool with the ship and slide . everything else be bore . next time would go to our other time share @ orange lake .",0,172
"i don ' t know why people be write such horrible review for this hotel . i mean you do realize you ' re not pay 5 star hotel rate right ? i love this hotel . my boyfriend and i have be go for year . anytime we have a problem it be solve right away very professionally . the room be always clean , the staff be very nice , and it ' s extremely close to universal studio , island of adventure , and wet & amp ; wild . the breakfast have plenty of option ! very easy and accessible . yes it may not be mama ' s delicious home make breakfast but it ' s still good and fresh . plus it ' s extremely convenient and money saving . sometimes when we ' ve be it have be very busy but i don ' t mind be a normal person and wait a few minute . i can ' t wait to go back !",1,172
"worth every dime we save to stay here . watch the `` wish '' firework display from our balcony every night be something my kid still talk about to this day . we stay in a one bedroom villa and it be more than enough room for my hubbie , 2 kid and myself . we take advantage of cook a lot of our meal in the villa and love have a washer and dryer in the roon . the ground be beautiful and the location of the blt be priceless . be able to walk back and forth from the magic kingdom in the middle of the day with two tired kid be so convenient . we will be forever spoil . future trip to disney will never be the same unless we book our stay here . our stay at blt make for one of our most memorable disny trip . we have stay at the grand flordian in the past and will never consider stay anywhere else again .",1,172
"this be a true review . in january 2013 i begin plan my parent surprise 50th anniversary party for september 9th through the 15th . i contact the group sale dept and speak with jean pierre and elisa and receive a great group rate . they be very professional until we check into the hotel . here be the list of problem my family and i experience . * the refrigerator didn ' t work , run toilet which over flow , we be lock out of our room for over 40 minute and then be tell we demagnetize the card which i know wasn ' t true , it end up be the battery to the key card lock need to be replace . the bathroom wall wasn ' t repaint after work be complete prior to our arrival . it be the most horrible experience i receive . i request to speak to elisa the sale manager on several occasion but she never contact me . dont stay there !",0,172
"well i can only rate the room since my wife , son and i only spent one night in the room and do not use any of the hotel facility . upon check in , i notice a very kid friendly lobby with a mini arcade and kid friendly food in a dining area . the staff that check u in be very friendly and accommodate . here ' s where thing go south . . . when we enter our room ( 707 ) , the stale , mold , cheap hotel odor immediately snatch me by the nose . though the smell be horrible , the room be clean for the most part but it be clear that this be no 5 ( nor 4 for that matter ) star hotel . fortunately for my family and mysel , we spend a total of maybe 7 hour in the room . we manage to have a good night rest and that be the extent of our stay there .",0,171
"i just have to be blunt - this place be a dump . it be dirty and smelly . everything be stain - the carpet , the tub , the tile , the ceiling . i don ' t want to take my shoe off because the floor be nasty . they ' ve take the lock off the door in the suite and the door altogether off the closet . there aren ' t in- room safe , which should be standard for a hotel for traveler ; the safety deposit box offer aren ' t big enough to hold a family ' s normal collection of electronics . and the staff be rude - if you don ' t want to be hospitable to guest , don ' t choose a job in the hospitality industry . but it do have suite , isn ' t expensive , and we can walk to universal . so maybe worth put up with the rest ? nope , never again .",0,171

"there where only two people at disney i felt be real , nice and not so fake . marina at magic kingdom who sell the balloon be really cool and nice . love her . the second be michelle bonilla at the boardwalk great person also love her . but disney all in all wasn ' t that great . when you go to the bakery on the boardwalk and be expect fresh hand make item you win ' t get it there . it should be call the pre- make bakery . plus i wouldn ' t buy any balloon at disney if you be plan to take them home on a plain because you will not be allow to take them on unless you deflate them . but you would think disney would let you buy one that be not with air so you can take it on the plain but no they be not allow to sell you one . so all in all disney suck .",0,170
"remember , it ' s a ' value ' resort , therefore it ' s not luxurious by any mean . you get a basic place to eat , sleep , and bathe with the all star movie resort , however for me there ' s one major reason i enjoy stay at this hotel . it have an entire building dedicate to herbie , the love bug ! unfortunately , the place be definitely in need of much renovation . there ' s always be a horrific smell that welcome you when you get off their elevator downstairs and begin walk up to the main building for the food court . the carpet look to have be the same since 1999 when the hotel open and i think they could do with some upgrade to the bathroom area in term of space a it be rather tight . other than that , this place be ' a- ok ' by my need in stay at a disney resort !",1,170

"in short , i ' ll be recommend that this joint make the naughty list this year . here ' s why : our room ( in this 100 % non smoking hotel ) smell like stale cigarette and hair tonic . strange sound emanate from the appliance . perhaps it be the ghost of guest who die in the room attempt to tell u to get out while we still can . my friend refer to the continental breakfast a `` the ninth circle of hell '' . i ' ll leave it at that . i think the towel be make from recycled sandpaper . no refill on necessity for our second night ( ie coffee ) . no in room coffee ? recipe for crankypants . blanket straight out of a homeless shelter and no extra . water pressure fail . on the bright side , free wifi , free parking , pet allow and the aforementioned free continental breakfast . so there ' s that .",0,170

good deal for the value of the resort . this isn ' t a 5 star hotel but it be clean and comfortable . the lobby be nice and the bed be comfortable . it ' s also nice to have bath and body work toiletry . our room also have a balcony which be nice . some of the negative i encounter be that our a/ c thermostat do not work and the sofa bed in the room be horrible ! there be wire stick out and two guest have to sleep on the floor because it be more comfortable than the sofa bed . do not eat breakfast downstairs ! the food be disgust ! also the tv or cable be not good at all it look like i be watch a fuzzy screen all night . so if you ' re on a budget and only plan to sleep in the hotel this be a good deal . otherwise book something a little nicer .,0,168
"super loud room - i could hear everything . i ' m a sound sleeper and i be keep up every night hear pipe , people walk down the hallway , the elevator . not good , but the room be gorgeous and clean . the food be awful , unhealthy , and expensive . everything be slather in sauce to the point that i felt sick after a few bite . the $ 17 burger i just ate be soggy with burger fat and aioli . the salad last night be white with dress . yikes . service be inattentive at best , but friendly enough . the worst part be the internet connectivity . i ' ve be incredibly frustrate , especially after pay $ 14 a day for internet , i get kick off every 20 minute , and the connection be hideously slow in the starbucks where i ' m write this ( while eat up data on my phone ' s hotspot )",0,168
"we have a good stay here go to disney . very nice people to deal with and very accommodate . simple , yet clean room . just what we need for the price . the only complaint i could have be there be no washcloth clean , so we have to use the smaller hand towel to shower with . and . . . . . the breakfast be lack . if they want to compete and hold their own in the market- - - - i would step it up a bit . look like they ' ve remodel lately and the foyer be delightful . elegant almost . then they go and serve toast and cereal ( and that ' s it ) for `` breakfast `` . if this isn ' t an issue with you - - then it win ' t be . plenty of restaurant within the nearby area . but for the price i pay , we get a value .",1,168
"so much potential that seriously miss the mark . we arrange for a car service from the airport that arrive 30 minute late . give that we have a toddler , we ask for turn down service with fresh towel and water each evening . every night they have forget to do it and say the will `` follow up '' although never seem to lead to fruition . we ' ve speak to housekeep , guest service , front desk and even multiple manager all to fall on empty promise . the hot tub in the spa didn ' t work and the massage be perform by someone who seem like have never give one before . lastly , housekeep ignore the `` do not disturb '' and let themselves into our room . the door hit the safety lock and wake our sleep toddler . all- in- all , we seriously think about leave early . either way , we win ' t be back .",0,168
"crowd and busy busy busy , just a i expect . the late hour for the hotel guest be much appreciate and really thin out the crowd - thankfully . my wife have never be and we get 40 % off coupon so . . . we finally visit . she really like the ride . i enjoyed epcot . our resort choice be a moderate one call coronado . overall a fair value with some goof by disney a well a mislead switcheroo regard the `` free '' shipping from the resort store . i will review the steak restaurant and the room separately . room service be very efficient and the room be kept clean . our towel request be handle well and room service be accurate , fast , food hot and plenty of condiment . cant say we will go again until we have grandkids . my wife and i seem to prefer european museum or the beach in the mexican gulf area .",0,168
"we truly enjoy our stay . my daughter describe it a cute . the room be very well decorate . although some people describe the room so small i think that be a misnomer . they be more than ample for two people . the hot tub on the second floor be a sellout for my teenage daughter who be able to get her panera bread macaroni and cheese and enjoy it at the hot tub . the park right across the street be great for walk in the evening . with a restaurant locate about halfway around . i also give this place prop for post on their website exactly what the room cost . there be no hidden fee such a parking , incidental , newspaper fee or any number of other thing that somebody can come up with to charge you . just a room price and tax . the desk be very helpful . i would definitely stay there again and will .",1,167
"stay at this location have be one of the worst , if not the worst , hotel experience of my travel adventure . not only do the location have bed bug , yes , bed bug , the manager deny the fact even after see a video and picture . after claim he examine the room by strip the bed , and find no bug , my sister and i go back to the room , only to find the room in the exact same state a we have leave it , with the sheet and blanket very much on the bed . my sister move the corner of the sheet , and the manager appear surprised to see the bed bug on both bed . i have never in my life experience such disgust . the location be recommend a a place to stay overnight pre- cruise ; however , i will never recommend this location to anyone . i be truly disgusted and disappointed .",0,167
"way better than my last courtyard marriott experience . super friendly staff , which be a huge bonus . nice lobby . clean room . not so much on the toiletry - just shampoo , conditioner and soap . also , the cleaning staff didn ' t refold my towel . i always reuse them , but i like it when they ' re hung back up and not just slung over my shower curtain . internet be plenty fast for me . stock `` market '' with any essential you may have forget . quiet air conditionercomfy bed . nice pool area . but no hot tub - bummer . only real minus be the fact that my balcony face the highway so that be a bit on the loud side when i be there . convenient to restaurant , shop , etc . it ' s not the four season , but then again , that ' s not what i pay for : )",1,167
"first , i would like to say that although this will be a bad review , our first front desk rep michael be extremely helpful and professional . unfortunately , it go down hill from there . we order and pay for a shuttle to universal studio and be tell that it would leave at 9 be . standing in the lobby since 8 : 55 be , we be never pick up . after confront the front desk staff , we be tell that we `` miss '' the shuttle . we stand in the lobby for an entire hour and a half be tell `` they ' re on the way '' . we ask for a refund and be deny . the manager rafael guerrero knew of the situation happen and do not come out at all to speak with u . completely unprofessional- completely unacceptable . i will definitely not be return and will definitely not be recommend this hotel to anyone .",0,167
"i can honestly say i will never stay at this resort even if it be free . my kid and i check into our villa on a thursday and we immediately notice several issue that need to be address . the entryway , both inside and out , be cover with spider web , spider , and egg . there be food in the fridge and crumb on the kitchen floor . also , the bed linen be very nasty and there be cobweb from wall to wall . i immediately too picture and contact resort service about the situation . the gentleman be very pleasant and apologize for the inconvenience and assure me that the resort would quickly correct the issue . to make a long story short , we check out on sunday morning and our issue with the villa be not resolve until 11pm saturday night ( let me remind you that i bring these issue up on thursday at check in ) .",0,167
"this be my first visit back to this hotel since it convert from the peabody hotel about a year ago . the staff at the front desk be very friendly , and make me feel like they be work to get me the best room available . however after we get to the room , we notice the room be a little bit tired . certainly not unhappy , but we know what a nice room can be . this particular room have an old school bathtub and a really poor shower head . at the end of the day i like to take a nice relaxing shower . this showerhead barely produce enough water to allow me to rinse the shampoo from my hair . the pool area remain very nice , and family with small child might enjoy the water slide . bar price be crazy a you ' d expect , but this hotel be near the convention center certainly meet my expectation .",1,167

"okay - cheap a heck , but don ' t stay here . hair and shaving all over the bathroom . grass in the bed ( not weed , actual grass from the great outdoors ) . what look like a severed chicken claw on the floor , and some strange unidentifiable clipping . what might be a coffee stain , or blood stain on the sheet . mold all over the shower/ bathroom . a plastic cup with strange mark on it - guess not replace . no shampoo , and and after call the front desk , `` i ' ll get you some in the morning. `` lot of hair on the towel - likely not wash since the last guest ( s ) . more thing i ' m forgetting . not okay . i don ' t review too harshly . but if there ' s ever a place that should be take over and revamp , this be it .",0,166
"the review on this hotel be correct and i regret not take them seriously . we stay here from 11/ 5- 12 and the experience be horrible and certainly not worth the money . we arrive at 12 and be not allow to check in so we give the bellman our bag . when we come back at 9 , we be tell that our king bed room have be sell out from under u and we would have to have two queen . i express my dissatisfaction with the clerk who couldn ' t have care le and be so annoyed . the room have sleep number bed , one of which be break and lumpy . the grout in the bathroom be disgust and the bathtub have rust on the bottom . the door do not shut unless you slam it . do not stay at this place ! there be plenty of other option on international drive that will make you happier !",0,166
we stay here for 3 day for my sister birthday and we have an amazing time . we actually stay in a 2 bedroom villa with a balcony and a full kitchen it be great . we go to the nearest walmart get ice and drink and snack and make it even better . they give u a villa look at the water fountain and the villa pool . the villa have there own private pool and they also have a beautiful pool with a slide and water fall and bar right next to the pool . everything be great and i cant wait to come back and stay here again . they also have shuttle bus to the park in case you don ' t have a car . everyone be friendly and helpful and they have so many different restaurant and 24 hour cafe a well . my entire family have amazing time here and our villa be clean and very well keep .,1,166
"this hotel be wonderful ! the staff be very friendly and helpful . they do everything possible to make u feel at home . the free hot breakfast be excellent ! they have a wide selection of food to choose from . the complementary `` light '' dinner monday- thursday be a bonus and exceed our expectation . they even offer wine and beer with the dinner ! each room have a kitchen with a full size fridge , microwave , dishwasher and stovetop . the bed be more comfortable than my own bed ! the maid service be extremely friendly , professional and accommodate . they have a pool , workout facility and laundry room . they have everything you could possibly think of to make your stay very comfortable . the hotel be only 15 minute away from the disney park , and be locate on a relatively quiet street . we will definitely be stay here again on our next orlando vacation !",1,166
"we stay here for four night during a last- minute trip to disney world . we usually stay at disney resort , but they be book due to the memorial day weekend . due to the proximity of the swan to epcot and hollywood studio , we decide to give it a shot . we receive a really great deal through the starwood website . the staff be very friendly and accommodate and the room be really nice . we enjoy the restaurant and pool area and really enjoy the `` dive- in '' movie at night . our room be very clean and housekeep do a great job . our only complaint be that our bed be not very comfortable and the pillow be pretty worn down . they seem old , a they do not have much , if any , cushioning . otherwise , we have a great experience and would definitely stay at the property ( or dolphin ) again .",1,165
"beautiful hotel with courteous , professional staff . not a long drive to disney world - - epcot only about 10 minute ride , and no traffic . well locate to go other place a well , and a good place to come back to . excellent kitchen , screen in balcony with pool view , forest behind hotel and well sound- proofed . plenty of movie , hot tub in room and at pool , good bar drink . cv across the street a well a chinese and pizza , gas station nearby . publix supermarket about two mile away . great hotel buffet breakfast with just about anything you could want from omelet to waffle to bacon/ sausage/ egg to pancake or oatmeal . they even have blintz one day . busy place in main hotel , le hubbub in villa . second bedroom not a spectacular a master , but the kid like it : have their own bathroom and tv .",1,165
good value for the timeshsre deal but would not stay otherwise . in return for a discount rate and ticket we stay here with our 2 kid for a week . pro : * washer and dryer in every unit* modern furnishing and tvscons : * halogen bulb in the elevator make it unbearable in the florida heat . * elevator often do not work make the heat even more uncomfortable cram in an elevator with 8 other people . * unclear check- in/ out direction . i have to call to find out how to take out the trash . this probably have not be explain to other patron because there be often trash bag leave in the walkway in front of room door . i also have to call to find out that patron be to wash their own towel instead of request new one overall i would not return unless offer another amazing discount on both park ticket and room rate .,0,165
can yelp create a half star option ? i perform the fastest check- in/ check- out in history . saw this place on for $ 33 a night so i think score . wrong ! wrong ! the elevator go to the third floor smell like melt crayon . the outside of the hotel be bland . you have to pay $ 0 . 25 for the ice machine which didn ' t even work . but the room . . . oh my damn . . . the room be the worst ever . ever ! it be already occupy by the roach . the smell be unbearable a heck . the phone didn ' t work and when i put it down a roach crawl out . guess it disconnect the line for me lol . so who should stay this place ? no one or meth head ! do not stay here . . . it be really a roach motel !,0,165
"i usually don ' t write review for most thing that be average and i stay in a lot of average hotel , but this place be anything but . just absolutely the worst hotel i have stay in for many year . i don ' t mind date , but date and dirty , poorly maintain , barely function be altogether a different thing . carpeting be too disgust to walk on with my bare foot , furniture be too stain to sit on , bathroom tile be chip , an air conditioner the come on with a roar every few minute so loud that you couldn ' t hear a tv at full volume and everything have the oppressive aura of a sad third world country . i don ' t have high expectation when i check in at a holiday inn , but this be so far below any expectation at any price that i have to try to warn others .",0,165
"have a really nice weekend there , the best thing be the pool and they also have a neat little lake that you can go sail on or kayak for free ! it ' s include with the resort fee . price be really high for food so just bring your own there be a little fridge in the room . the door to the bathroom be kinda awkward it slide one way and close to the bathroom door and when it open it close the closet door . wifi signal be only 3- 2 bar in my room not so great and the in room ethernet cable didn ' t work , nor do the provide hdmi interface the tv be lock down so you can only use the remote control to turn it on and off which be seriously annoy . still it ' s a great resort and very beautiful and pretty well maintain . also enjoy our meal at hemingway .",1,165
"we book a king size room . the second day of our stay they have u change room due to construction in our building . when we walk down to the lobby to change room they didn ' t even have one available for u , after we pack all our stuff up and put it in the car . the second room they put u in be a 2 queen bed room , which be not be we want . they say all king room be book and would put one on hold for u the next day . they never call to notify u that the king room be available . in between all the room change and not be happy with the room they put u in , all they do be apologize . i ask for u to be upgrade to another room and they wouldn ' t do that for u . we will not be stay here again .",0,165
"there be no surprise ; hyatt be dependable and you know what you ' re get with them so the only reason i ' m post this be to particularly note that my family enjoy the breakfast both morning we be there , comment that the egg dish and the breakfast sausage and the pancake be all good ( in contrast to the last hyatt house where we have stay ) . the fact that it be walk distance to the universal park be very helpful , a the shuttle be full on occasion and we have too hoof it either to or from the park . yes , the shower/ tub be very basic and the pool be small and the wifi be unusable most of the time ( probably due to all the teen in the hotel use it for their social networking ) , but for our purpose this hotel fit the bill just fine for our family of four .",1,164
"a wdw resort exclusively for military personnel and their family . it ' s locate near the magic kingdom , and be actually within the paid parking area for magic kingdom . this resort be own by the department of defense and you need to show your military id to pass through the gate . this be originally disney ' s golf resort . the ground be well kept , the lobby be beautiful . it feel like a decent chain hotel throughout the rest of the property . it ' s not glamorous , or fun theme like disney own resort and if it wasn ' t for the unbeatable price , i ' d stay elsewhere . if you ' re look for `` wow '' you ' ll prefer other resort . if you prefer save money , with no frill , but still in the heart of walt disney world . . . shade of green be your place .",1,164
"i ' d say it more 2 1/ 2. the lobby be pimp , but the rest be sub par . gym . . . 4 piece of equipment , 2 of which be out of order , no bueno ! the elevator area and elevator r like something out of a seedy motel movie scene . room r ok , updated- ish . bathroom/ shower not the greatest but decent . for have get this deal on hotwire it be an ok deal . i think i ' d opt for a higher rated hotel though . the kick in the pant be the resort fee . . . uhhhhh like wtf ? ! there be nothing resorty about this place . i do wan na give prop to the staff who be very nice , and least that be good . i forget to mention that the bed r caca here too . wake up each day with a jack up back",0,164
"the location be very close to downtown disney . folk , there be no coffee maker and no microwave oven in the room . if you be a coffee maniac , like me , you can buy it on the first floor . the room be nice . large screen tv , spacious bathroom , plenty of towel . if you plan to do a lot of activity at disney , consider take free shuttle bus that depart from the hotel every thirty minute . my husband be always drive when he go to disney , but this time we take the bus all the time , and i have to admit it be very convenient . just hop on the bus , remember the number , and after you be do , make sure you be at the right station , so the same bus would take you back to the hotel . i would rate b resort , a alright hotel .",0,164
"this hotel be really nice . our stay be for a week and be enjoyable . it ' s a family/ friend orient hotel and nothing to u be really bad . the only downside be their shuttle service . they ' re great for take you to your destination ( disney parks/ universal studio ) but come back be the hard part since they use a different shuttle service and not their own . recommend go to breakfast early , a the later you wait , the more messy it get because more family start roll thru . the staff be really nice and professional , and that ' s include their own shuttle diver . they really cater to our need , from provide extra sheet and pillow , to more water bottle in our room . all in all , we don ' t regret book this hotel and it seem we find our goto hotel for orlando park visit .",1,164
"well , sometimes you get what you pay for . on the interior , the hotel be very nice ; a clean and decent radisson . the pool be decent . . . nothing special , but a private spot for catch a tan and relaxing . there be not much in walk distance , but within a mile you can find shopping and food . this all sound great right ? not if you don ' t want to wake up at 3 in the morning to hear drunk girl fight in the parking lot . i wouldn ' t think much of it , if it didn ' t happen every night i be here . ucf be very close and i ' m bet that the hotel bar be a hangout . i ' m sure this doen ' t happen every night , but i ' m think that the hotel security guard earn every penny of their paycheck .",0,164
"i be give this 3 star because i think half the people love it and the other half hate it . i recently spend a week here and enjoy myself . i be annoy by the fakeness of it all and bother that for many people this be the closest they will come to travel to another country . with that say , i can definately understand why family come here - the kid love it ! watch the child get all excite over the disney character be alot of fun . one note on the food , we do the meal plan , and find the quality good but not outstanding . i think if you don ' t eat out much the food will be top notch . i didn ' t feel it stand up w/ the quality of food i have try a other upscale restaurant . but i didn ' t have a plate i refuse to eat .",1,164

"don ' t be fool by the spacious lobby . this place be no better than any other econo hotel , and to be honest i ' ve stay at much better place for much le . the room be small and cramped . advertise a a two bedroom suite but really one room with a partial divider between the bed and couch . only one tv in the room that you have to rotate depend on which `` room '' you be in . i find the bed really uncomfortable . the breakfast really suck . powder egg , powder juice and the sane muffins you find everywhere . i ' d say the room be clean enough , not sparkle but just good enough for me not to leave . the only redeeming factor about this hotel be the staff . they be all very helpful and pleasant . however they couldn ' t overcome this sub par hotel .",0,162
"this hotel be extremely outdated and not what be expect from a hilton . the staff be friendly but the hotel seem very dirty . i wish i have flip flop to use to walk around the room . i think i might catch something if i be barefooted . after a long day of travel i arrive to an old , dirty room . the bathroom be disgust . there be hair everywhere ; on the toilet , in the shower drain , in the sink , and on the floor . disgust ! ! ! ! when i travel i always do a `` bed bug '' check and i look at the mattress . it do not have bed bug but it be dirty and stain . it be probably at least 15+ year old . i will never stay here again and will rethink stay at any hilton . they be not what they use to be .",0,162
"the staff here be wonderful . they ' re professional and helpful and great . the hotel hall be outdated , but they ' re clean . i can tell that the staff really try . my biggest complaint be the lack of food option in this hotel . there be the carnivale restaurant , but it ' s very overpriced . one bud light be $ 7 . 35. there ' s a starbucks , but they only serve drink and pastry - no breakfast sandwich . the only other option be the palm court deli which be horrible ! ! ! the food be disgust . hamburger burn to a crisp , small , overpriced pizza ( $ 10 ) that taste like a $ 1 frozen pizza that someone make in the microwave , etc . a small , snack size bag of mixed nut be $ 5 ! this place be ridiculous and the food be horrible .",0,162
"wow , i agree with the other review - don ' t judge this hotel by it outside appearance . we book a room for 1 night due to it yelp review and cheap rate ( 69/ night ) . when we pull up i start think i have make a mistake but once i step inside it all change ! lobby be super swanky and have an indian restaurant and cafe inside . the room be really nice we be so impressed . bathroom be huge . sheet be clean ; everything be clean . only reason why it get 4 star instead of 5 be that the fan would reset after an hour to it baseline temp and it wasn ' t the quietest stay but not a big deal . oh also the sheet be kinda rough and not soft but who care , it ' s so cheap and the quality of the room be worth it !",1,162
"helpful staff . pool be dirty saturday night but not other day . nice and warm water and really hot hot- tub . great shuttle to/ from universal and walk to wet n wild . if miss shuttle , taxi be only $ 7 if go to u . ( save $ $ not park at universal. ) . good food selection at free breakfast . only try one dinner and be fine . nice selection of snack in the lobby to purchase that be not way overprice like other stuff in the area . have coupon for u restaurant and thing at the desk . room same a any other homewood . fridge microwave and stovetop . others use gas grill on hotel property . a/ c be loud ( sound like have leaves/ paper blowing in it . any issue overall i think to be expect during a very busy spring break and theme park location . good value .",1,162
"sadly , do not meet my expectation . i take my parent there for a surprise anniversary and birthday present . i regret ever do that . we get to the hotel and parking be a fortune . okay fine it disney what do you expect ? we get there early a check in time be 2 pm . we check out the hotel and some thing be hard to find . there be no map on the premise . 4 pm come around and my room still isn ' t ready . i ask the front desk and they say another half hour . 5 pm be here and we be finally get our room . we go to our room and it be very out date . for be a disney hotel i be not impressed . this will be the first and last time i ever stay at this hotel . save your money people . go elsewhere !",0,162
this hotel have recently be completely upgraded . i have actually stay at this property a handful of time over the past 20 year and it have never be quite this nice before . our stay be quiet and peaceful and you simply can ' t beat the quality that you get for the money . they really take excellent care of the room and property in general . we stay over on a sunday night and i guess they weren ' t very busy a it be apparent that housekeep be do an extraordinary job clean the room . we realize later that they be actually shampoo the carpet in every room . this be apparent because not only do we see the carpet cleaner at one point but all the bed be turn because they clean the under them . even with all this work we never hear a sound . highly recommended and close to disney a well .,1,162
go for a week mini vacation with my boyfriend and brother . the hotel accommodate u on our room . originally we have one room with one bed . there be a storm that hit two day in new york before we could even leave to orlando . the hotel give u a room with two bed at no extra charge . it be perfect for rest and relax . the starbucks breakfast be a little pricy but there ' s a golden coral like 2 minute away walk . safe hotel and close to walt disney world and universal studio . i will definitely recommend and visit the hotel again ! the wifi wasn ' t amazing but it work and i ' m on vacation so i wasn ' t on my laptop or phone for hour . i didn ' t hear the other guest while sleep . this place be perfect for stay i will go back !,1,162
this be a 3 star course . drive a little out of the way to get here probably expect a bit more since they have pga qualifier here . they have two course and i play the crooked cat so i can ' t comment on the other 18. course be trim very well . tee box be in good shape . green get plugged two week ago which they inform me at start . they be still in recovery and need about a week or two to roll true although really not bad and definitely playable without much concern . it be very long from the tip about 7500 yard but they have plenty of choice . course be fairly fun and not too bad and not to great . would definitely try the other course if i live around here or have more time . no gps but i think they have an app on their website for that .,1,162
"there be some def pro about stay at this value disney resort . first , free parking at dw and free magic band . so that ' s great . we even get in extra early 7 be and they be able to get u into our room ! but the con . . . oh the con . . . . disney be so absolutely amaze that this resort be . . . . fine . it ' s cheap , $ 150 a night , but you don ' t get much in room space although our room be clean . and i be pretty let down by the food court . . . nothing really special and still abt $ 10+ a person . so i be glad i go , but would go back . kinda take the buzz out of a disney trip to go to a hotel which be . . . fine . . .",0,162
"have a great weekend at this hotel . the front desk staff be friendly . even ask at check out if everything be pleasant with our stay . the room be very nice . big screen tv , refrigerator , microwave , coffee maker and safe . bed be very comfortable , we sleep like a baby . we stay on the third floor , it be very quiet . my son and enjoy the game room , especially the air hockey table . very nice fitness center . love the $ 4 . 99 buffet breakfast . if you be go to universal it right around the corner a short walk . right across a street from wet and wild and down the street from walgreen ' s. very nice pool and spa . i be definitely go back and recommend . great location right on international drive and a hop skip and a jump from the florida turnpike .",1,161
it really wasn ' t a bad a most of the review i have read say . it ' s not the fanciest place but it get the job do . you get what you pay for . it be inexpensive and 10 minute away from universal . the room be clean ( it do have a little bit of a funny smell ) the staff be nice . we have a problem with the tv call the front desk and with out a problem or attitude someone come right over and take care of it . over all it be not a bad place to stay for the money and location you can ' t beat it . it ' s a shower and a bed . if your on vacation and your spending that much time in your hotel room you don ' t know how to vacation . i enjoy my stay and i would go back .,1,161

"horrible , my room be from 1970 with a vcr sign by the cube tv . . . . i be ready to check right out but my husband and kid really want to go to the new waterpark on the resort . when i book the trip they say the park be 10 $ each , when we get to the hotel the front desk say 13 $ but of course when we get to the park oh no ! im sorry i dont know why they keep confuse the guest . . . the person who book you get commision so thats why they confuse people . . . what kind of a place do this . . . never again ! ! ! we have a 90 min meeting for them to try to sell u the timeshare the meeting last 5min/ can you really sell u on a 1970 room . . better deal online anyday .",0,161

"employee be kind of nice ( not very helpful ) . when we get to the front desk they ignore u for a period of time or when we be get the card they would work on something else and then give slight attitude if we try to talk to them . breakfast be fine , i wasn ' t too upset or thrill with it . the tv kinda suck a well a the battery in the remote dying and we be not issue new one . what really take the cake be at least four of our neighbor be very loudly engage in sexual intercourse , i also saw a lot of child at the hotel so i don ' t know how that be explain to them . not to mention my next door neighbor scream at each other for two hour . all in all , definitely wouldn ' t come back .",0,157
"luckily , i pricelined this hotel , b/ c there be no way i would have spend the normal rate for these room . they be typical . self- parking be $ 12 a day and let me tell you it be quite the walk . i hope you don ' t get up to your room and realize you left something in your car ! i think this be a somewhat decent hotel if you be just there to use their amenity . otherwise i would have rather stay in a hotel where the parking be close , shuttle be free to theme park , parking be free , internet be free , you can order pizza if you want ( this hotel will not allow you to order food from outside vendor , you can only use room service ) and be a better value . i would recommend that you not stay here .",0,157
"i have be here so many time for business i have lose count but every time i be here it be always a pleasant stay . i do wish the lighting in the bathroom be better , it ' s approach a roadside texaco quality and i have be tell them for year about it , but i ' ve come to accept that win ' t change . this be a huge place , so if you get stick in the west tower you be football field away from the lobby/ conference space so bring your walking shoe . i like that they have upgrade some restaurant and the sport bar be decent enough a be the hotel bar although if a 2 , 000 person conference be in town , the 20 or so seat at the bar will be snap up immediately a will the seating built for only around 100 it seem .",1,157
"pleasant enough for the price if you have a getaway car . staff be very friendly . best perk be a hot breakfast for under $ 10 , complete with waffle machine and egg cook to order . no on- site din otherwise , but delivery be available from nearby restaurant , and the front counter have menus . exercise room be about the size of my home bathroom , but clean and bright , with two treadmill , a cycling machine , and weight - and seemingly underused . tiny outdoor pool and hot tub with patio . the only thing within walk distance be the parking lot . if you be feel adventurous , you can hike a half mile to a little complex contain a 7- eleven , chick- fil- a , and wendy ' s for all your junk food need . ea ( entertainment art ) be right across the expressway .",1,157
"just complete a two night stay and be satisfy with most aspect of the hotel . room be nice , staff be friendly and the property be extremely well maintain . the park situation be not favorable . long walk , hard to find entrance and exit , have to swipe key to leave the lot and i have to pay extra for the `` privilege '' . walk path for exercise have a 1/ 4 mile portion that be also the employee and service entrance which be very busy in the morning . be prepare to dodge some car . not dangerous just inconvenient for u and the employee . they should find a better way to get through that area . the only other drawback be that the concierge be in a back corner and i only stumble upon her when walk around . she be helpful but chew gum while talk . thanks .",1,157
"nancy p. a per the sunglass you saw wak out with no those be not the one miss . upon leave they offer to open up a claim for them we decline because i didn ' t want to waste our time anymore and sure that we be not go to have the glass return to u . it ' s not about the money with the glass it ' s about sentimental value . yes your be right the valet charge be drop , big deal i ' m still miss the glass . 25 $ for the use of a micro- wave be ridiculous ! and 8 $ plus a 3 . 50 $ for roomservice that we order 8oz of milk . i have stay in many upscale resort and never have go threw this . once again i will never spend my money at the walt disney world swan and dolphin hotel .",0,157
"from the time we check in to the time we check out at 5 : 30 in the morning , we be greet with friendly and very accomodating staff . my husband and i and my 4 year old son have the most amazing 2 night at the waldorf . the staff from the bell men , the front desk , room service and other staf all greet u with smile and enthusiasm . the room ( firework view ) and it amenity be impeccable ! we will definitely consider this hotel when we ' re back in orlando . it ' s so close to disney park and other orlando site . the room service price be reasonable and you get a good amount of food for what you pay for . they give you a complimentary bread and fruit with your order . i highly recommend this hotel . you will definitely love it !",1,157
"we stay at this hotel for one night before drive to another part of florida . the location be great - right by downtown disney . hotel room have recently be renovate and the bed be comfortable , but we move the couch and find some pretty gross trash underneath . the laundry room have a fire at 4am , and the entire hotel have to be evacuate . we wait outside for about 45 minute with fire truck and do not get one update from hotel staff . a security guard let u back in and the next morning none of the staff want to acknowledge what have happen . at least a sorry would have be nice since it be their own fault ( didn ' t clean the lint trap in a dryer ) . i get it on for $ 120 , and base on other review i think i overpay too .",0,157
stay here last week a part of a group . this be an older courtyard so not the modern look . who care about that because the staff be fantastic . from check in ( made sure i know exactly how to get to my room and best spot to park ) . room service staff and all worker would pass in the hall during the day be very friendly . we have use one of their crib ( it ' s a pack and play ) and the baby wet the sheet . call down for a new one and they be there fast ) . would stay here again . only bad thing be the free wifi connection be bad . never get connection on our side of the hotel . can ' t gripe too much because it be free anyway . . . but thats why i ' m not give 5 star,1,157
"plain and simple , you will not get more bang for your buck in this area of orlando . most other hotel do not tell you that they be also go to charge you for park , or a resort fee which come a a surprise when you check in . typically you can add another $ 30 to your bill just for these fee . this be not the case at drury inn which not only do not charge you for these thing , but also provide free internet , hbo , wifi , hot breakfast with all the fixing , and always very polite and helpful staff along with the cleanest facility you will find around . there ' s a reason out 358 hotel in the orlando area this one consistently rank in the top 5. we enjoy our stay and plan on stay at other hotel in this chain in the future .",1,157
"i just return from orlando , and stay at this marriott . it consider a resort property , so your status with marriott , be worthless . there be no concierge lounge , or free internet , or anything you might be use to from marriott . the hotel be sell out , and it be quite evident . there be two hotel on the property . i ate at the expensive steakhouse and the italian restaurant . both be very good . my reason for award 2 star , be the $ 25 cost for valet , and the amount of time to get your car range from 40 min to a hour . the hotel need to better prepared when it sell out . at $ 25 per car per day , the can easily afford more car jockey . i will not stay here again , it just too big and crowd .",1,156
"stay here for work recently . the hotel be totally fine , room be quite nice , and the pool be awesome . the on- site dining be not bad , but not great either . the biggest thing that drop this hotel from 4 to 3 star for me be the fact that be in what i would describe a a wasteland . it like one of those final gate area that be safe from the zombie horde after some apocalyptic event . this situation will be remedied over time i would imagine a the hotel continue to expand over the land it own ( which have a nice lake/ pond with walk path around it ) and the hotel be nice , but right now the location be a bit stark . our group use their meeting room which be nice a catered very well . i ' d stay there again though .",1,156
"just get to this hotel about 4 hour ago . have not be able to get check in early . . check out be at 11am so we will see how long we have to wait to get in . this will determine the star rating outcome . update : it ' s be 6 hour and although the concierge have state that there be no early checkins due to availability , ( even though i saw more than 15 people check out ) , we be still wait to get check in . funny thing be other people who have arrive have be give a room . . i ' m not sure how that ' s possible if there be no room ? this will definitely be address to higher ups . will never stay here again . worst experience of my life and i ' m 32. it ' s that bad .",0,156
"do not stay here ! we just spend a week here in a hotel that be not very nice and on top of that whats a rip off ! they charge for extra towel and everything . on top of that my credit card be over charge ! they be rude and only speak spanish in front of you and several time i believe be speak about u . carpet be dirty and stain unfortunately with be in floridia we couldn ' t stay anywhere else on short notice . they breakfast they state be bread and an orange . the heated pool have no heat and the bathtub we have , have mold in it . and no wifi because it doesnt work . my sister also stay there and have the light flicker the whole time but even if you complain they would never give you any money back for your awful stay !",0,156
"the only thing i like about it be the washer/ dryer . good thing we only pay like $ 300 for 6 day . really , you get what you pay for . this place look so outdated . we ask for one of the newly remodel room , but do not get it so i will give a one star review . you really do get what you pay for , but pay $ 600 for amusement park ticket make one want to be frugal at a place you ' ll end up just sleeping and bathing in . i think we would have be better off at a newly remodel holiday inn . last time i get a package deal at expedia . i always get excited , when i see good review , but this place be ew . it sort of do look section 8ish a one reviewer write . . .",0,156
"my wife and i stay here last week in the aruba . when we arrive there be a moldy banana in the fridge and an old yogurt . floor be filthy and garbage behind the nightstand . first expression count for me and i wasn ' t wife say leave them a note for tomorrow and see . the next day after we get do with the park housekeeping clean the fridge but didn ' t vacuum nor dust . by the 3rd day , i be tick off because the kleenex be wet and smell like the toilet . i call management and they apologize and comped u a night stay , after we leave the hotel . i will never return to that resort . we will pay more or stay off site for disney . the room be filthy , a/ c clog with dust . worse than a super 8 motel .",0,156
"i go to purchase disney ticket from the expedia local expert counter since i be stay at the courtyard orlando lake buena vista . they charge me for my 2 year old daughter even though i find out after i ' ve be at the park that child from 0 to 3 year old be free . then , i call them to request a refund and their answer be that there be nothing they could do and sorry for the inconvenience . they also say they didn ' t have time for me since they have a line wait in front of them . i believe they be misrepresent disney , and they don ' t even ask at the time of purchase for the child ' s age even though my child be right by my side at the time of purchase . please , don ' t buy from these seller .",0,155
"great location for a seaworld visit . you can walk from the property . good value for a clean , comfortable room and bed . nice family resort with three pool , mini golf , hot tub , toy . i stay in tower . restaurant be good . snack deli on site . economical resort if you have kid and easy walk to seaworld . only one of three pool heat but it work out a it wasn ' t too crowd . nice ground and great staff . village inn across the street along with a subway shop and gas station quick mart . bed pillow and sheet well take care of and be comfortable . not the ritz but not the ritz price ! i recommend a a must especially if visiting seaworld a the convenience be worth it . the only negative be $ 10 a day to park there .",1,155
"i didn ' t have a fridge in my first room and they be nice enough to change my room at no extra cost . i go to the new room and it be a bit bigger . the bathroom be pretty small and this one be better , we have a microwave a well . i ' m so picky about bug and bathroom , but this be clean i didn ' t see a bug . the room do smell a bit funky but i ' m sure it ' s be a use people go swim etc and come and leave the carpet wet , but with the ac on it no biggy . the breakfast be nice , they have toast , make your own waffle , good oj , oatmeal . so the basic breakfast stuff and i enjoy it . it ' s also very close to universal .",1,155
"let me start by state : i stay at many high quality resort across the country . i spend 9 day on my trip here to orlando and the service at this resort be above and beyond anything i have expect , from check in , to attach zen restaurant , to room service , to ballroom service to check out . i don ' t think i ' ve ever be treat so well , especially since i mention it to the sweet lady who bring up my minestrone soup to my room and i mention i be have stomach issue . i get a call from the hotel ask if i need anything else and they also check up on me the following day and bring me complimentary chamomile tea ! ! ! ! highly recommend this place and i would love to come back again . thank you omni ! ! !",1,155
"we stay for 7 night in august . we would absolutely stay at this hotel again . our only complaint be 1 ) in our particular room , we could hear the people in the room next to u clear a day through the air vent . that get a little annoy when they come in from the night club at 2- 3 be and 2 ) we wish the food court would be open earlier/ later ( maybe even 24 hour ) even if just for the cooler item ( premade sandwich , snack , beverage ) . the room be clean and i love the zest and alberto v05 ! the staff be friendly and very helpful . we never have to wait on either end for shuttle bus . rob the bus driver be awesome . i think the bowling be a little pricey , but that be an optional expense .",1,155
"the room have a very unpleasant smell , like try to use the cheap detergent to cover something . ugh ! the air condition unit in the room be filthy . we figure part of the bad smell be from there . we turn it off and open the door to the patio ( glad they have that ) let in the fresh air , which help . it ' s nice they provide free hot breakfast . only wish they could change the hot food item once in a few day . the morning of our checkout , they didn ' t put up a wet floor sign after the staff mop the floor in front of the elevator . our kid slip when we notice the water on the floor . we have good experience with the other comfort inn location in the past , but this one be a huge disappointment .",0,155
"i just stay here for 2 night while in town for a work seminar . the location be great . . . close to seaworld and just a few minute from the convention center and i- drive and nice and close to the highway yet you can not hear any outside traffic noise which be nice . i be able to check- in right away and everyone that work here be very nice and helpful . the room be very clean , bed be decently comfortable and i be able to get a good night ' s rest each night . free wi- fi which be hard to find in hotel so that be definitely nice . i would have like a continental breakfast but you can pay for breakfast in the morning if need be . parking be ample and i never have to walk too far to get into the hotel .",1,154
"i go to this water park / hotel . it seem like a motel kind of place with a water park build in . i didn ' t stay there the night so i can ' t comment on the room and service , but the water park be great for kid . it ' s not a huge water park so it be easier to keep an eye on the kid . the kid don ' t care too much about the size of the water park . they just have fun be out and in the water . the price be also cheap compare to the big water park like wet n ' wild and blizzard beach . i would probably take kid to this water park again especially if it ' s a bigger group ( price ) , but i don ' t think i would stay the night .",0,154
"abort abort ! ! do not stay here ! plain room with gross carpet . bathroom fan didn ' t work , ac be very loud and turn off and on all night without the ability to keep it on , bathroom smell like urine . the whole place smell terribly like smoke even though we have a `` non smoking '' room . there be also no towel rack by the shower . i have to put my towel on the toilet to reach it . bathroom be very large which be nice , we use the fridge but it freeze our drink . sheet seem fresh , hot breakfast be pretty good , staff be friendly . we wouldn ' t stay at this location again , but it didn ' t give u too many nightmare . the place basically remind u of the perfect murder scene from a movie .",0,154
"great staff , great service , great restaurant , great decor and cleanliness . the room be little on the ghetto side . the tv or cable ( still can ' t figure which be screw up ) be awful . every channel we try watch be either fuzzy , go blank , the sound be go in and out . the lamp in our room be do the same . either flicker lamp or nothing at all . the ihome radio for ipod be in the middle of the bed on the night stand and that thing be a piece of sh* t ! nothing work in our room . one of the two phone didn ' t work , a few of the outlet didn ' t work , the keurig machine be a piece of sh* t too . like i say , everything but the room be great ! lol",1,154
"ok. so i just realize there be two tower . . . i ' m must be in the old one . i really hate when the lobby of the hotel be mislead . it ' s very nice . the room- not so much . i ' ll give it large , so likely good for vacationer with lotsa luggage . but the the furtnitue , the carpet , the whole vibe be econo lodge . not a drop of lux anywhere . best thing in the room be the large window . it ' s old . . i ' m also very unhappy about the lint all over the pillow and sheet , like they drop them on a dusty floor and put them in the bed anyway . i ' m two second from check out . yes - i ' m a hotel snob . proud of it !",0,154
"i actually really liked this hotel . the location be a little hard to find but everything else be really good . only 5 minute from universal studio and approximately 15 minute from the disney park , this hampton inn be very affordable and great for the price . free complimentary breakfast that range from egg , waffle , cereal , etc , we save a lot on that . the bed be clean and comfy . clean service everyday unless you choose not to have it . the staff be really nice and welcome . wifi be not free everyday . if you be stay only a day , you can consider it free but if you be stay more than a day , wifi be available only 24 hour . i have no complaint about this hotel . it be just great and i recommend this to anyone and everyone .",1,153

"the good : the water slide , lazy river and pool . the poolside cabana be only $ 5 per hour to rent . poolside bar . the condo be relatively nice . close to disneythe bad : dirty outside of condo . no management . it ' s a free for all . wifi be useless . frig be unplug . no service around the pool , waitress ectno lifeguard . cable tv sucksfurniture be uncomfortable worker work on the outside of our unit while we ' re in it without notification . i have to clean out the lazy river everyday . . . beer can and water bottlesrundown area around the resort . questionable people at the pool/ neighborhood . unprofessional sale presentation to buy into property . do not follow proper process around customer service . understaffed in the recreation dept . we win ' t be back .",0,153
"this hotel suck . i ' ll cut to the chase . do you like get lock out of your room ? how about elevator that operate slower than molasses ? a seriously sorry excuse for a `` bar '' . a breakfast that ' s free because they couldn ' t make anyone pay for it , oh , and you better be there before 9 : 15. plan on tether to your cell phone for wifi because their internet bandwidth and wifi signal be about a slow a their elevator . gym be weak . the lobby lack any sort of atmosphere or sophistication . clean staff slam door at 8am . be ready for your cold shower since i have no hot water at 3pm . it ' s more like a mix between a day inn that meet downtown orlando . two star because the room be clean .",0,153

"for the price this place be an absolute steal . very nice property , very nice room . if you be go to buy ticket to the park just do so yourself and avoid the `` discount price '' from the concierge desk unless you want to wake up at 730am for a 90 minute presentation . also , while it save u a lot of money , the shuttle service to and from the park be a little unprofessional . when pick u up from the park there be three driver pick up guest of 5- 6 different hotel and none of them knew who be go where . it be very disorganized and have a very sketchy feel to it . overall though , i ' ve get ta give the hotel itself 4 star . very happy i randomly find it online and book it . absolute steal .",1,152

"i use to love disney world . we always say we would love to live there . but they just keep building more and more hotel on the property but not expand the park . the park be so crowd now there be no magic left . every one standing in the three hour line star at their phone and completely ignore those they come with , might a well be there by themselves . even the new ride they do build be more six flag then disney . all they do be cannibalize the old snow white ride . they take off the dwarf in the mine and the scene of them dance in the dwarf home and stick it on a child ' s rollercoaster . it be the saddest trip to disney i have ever be on . i don ' t think i will be back",0,150
"be these 4/ 5 star review a joke ? i stay in 2 room , and in each , the tub wouldn ' t drain . i go to the front desk and let them know that the first room have a plug tub . i wasn ' t in the room when the repairman enter , but he track dirt into the room . also , the tub be still plug . change room , and same thing in the second room . let the front desk know , but nobody every come to fix the 2nd room ( or , again , maybe just didn ' t fix ) . i be only there for 2 night so i just dealt with it . these thing happen , but the front desk person be extremely rude and unhelpful . spend a little more money and stay elsewhere .",0,150

"excellent hotel for the price . the staff be very friendly and helpful from the valet to the front desk to the maid . the room be spacious and clean . it ' s a good hotel for family and couple and be very close to everything . the negative : the resort fee be $ 24 . 00/ day and parking be $ 18 . 00/ day which we felt be pricey . also , it be nice to see a fridge in the room but it wasn ' t one to keep food in ( temperature be super low ) and couldn ' t be adjust . even drink didn ' t stay chill . . . not sure the point of that . lastly , the shower head be very low for someone under 5 ' 10 or so , but not a deal breaker .",1,149
"i be double bill for valet parking and self parking , which when i point it out to the front desk person she immediately fix the issue . i pay our entire bill in cash and then when i go to leave the valet would not give me our key , and make a scene which be very embarrassing ; say we have not pay our bill and say i have to go wait in line again to speak to the front desk person . of course by this time the line be very long . when i get to the front counter they say there be no problem and i make them call valet to hand u our key . it be stressful and very embarrassing ! we drive off with such a sour taste in our mouth and we be just so stress out and angry !",0,149

"i stay here about a decade ago , and then again a month ago . i felt like i be have flashback - everything look exactly the same , so it seem a bit dated and in need of some updating . otherwise , the service be great . the room be not impressive - also date in style and in bathroom fixture . the restaurant in the resort be the best part - very fine option - something for every budget and taste . that be my favorite part of the week- long stay . i ' d give them one star if rating on the hotel alone , but since the service be so friendly , and the restaurant be so great , it be worth a three- star rating . if the hotel get some update , i ' d gladly give four star !",0,148
"terrible . no greeting a you walk- in . the front desk staff with different uniform and no name tag . the room they give u be on the outside building ( because i book through expedia / groupon ) . when we go to the room it be not ready , with two maintenance men still work in the room , it have a strong smell of bleach even with the door and windows open . we go back to the front desk ask for the manager , of course be not available , someone dress like a disco girl come with no name tag and with an attitude make matter worse . after i call choice customer service which really wasn ' t too much of help , they walk u to another hotel . in the future choice hotel will not be my choice .",0,148

beautiful property . the ground be neatly and regularly manicure . the amenity be great for a short or extended get away . i ' ve stay on the property ( marriott grand vista ) approximately 5 time and marriott cypress habour at least once . my only issue with the resort be they have cockroach . the first cockroach be in the bathroom at cypress & amp ; i ' ve see 2 in the bedroom at grande vista in the past 2 day . for the rate and the reputation of their chain they can certainly do better . i ' ve see other complaint online and the `` solution '' provide to the customer from marriott be unacceptable . i will be speak to the property manager ; i be rethink ever stay at any marriott property ever again .,0,143

"a good hotel with some great and not so great amenity for child . my kid and i stay for a couple day in july and they have a great time . they love the live gator , slide and water splash area and the dive in movie on friday and saturday night . for such a large hotel i felt the pool area be too small . it remind me of the public city pool . at one point it be wall to wall child and parent . i have stay at a few other resort in that area of orlando and they have significant larger pool ( marriott world ) . the room be standard room , nothing to right home about . what ' s great be the variety of restaurant , splash park , frozen yogurt shop .",1,142
"for the price you really can ' t expect to much . bed be comfy and clean . bathroom door could use a wipe down a there be tiny mold spot start to show up and the bath mat have mold stain a well , but you could tell it have be bleach . we like that it be pet friendly and we be able to have our dog stay with u . didn ' t like that housekeep come in while we be go despite the `` do not disturb '' sign be up and the 8am knock at the door ask if we ' d check out yet . other then that there be enough space for our family . 2 adult 2 kid ( age 8 and 1 ) and our pug . we would stay there again .",0,142
"i have a really bad experience here . the ceiling be leak in the bathroom . they have this nice little breakfast menu for room service . you can just fill it out and leave it on the door handle and it suppose to just arrive in the morning , it never come the fist day and the second day i wish it hadn ' t ( it be nasty ) . also they put u in a room at the very end of the hall that be right next to an exit door . you have to use your room key to gain access to the building . our door be so close to this door that we keep wake up in the night because it sound exactly like some one be come into your room . it be spooky .",0,142
"my advice be to stay elsewhere . you can find other option with more bang for your buck and not get harass about a time share ! bad : pay for park , they aggressively push their time share , the `` short walk '' to seaworld be across a steaming hot parking lot without a side walk , their shuttle service suck ! it only run twice in the morning and one of those time be an hour and a half after the park open . the staff be apathetic and the food price in their restaurant be very high but since there be only two restaurant in the vicinity you be leave with few choice , and you have to pay for internetgood : room be clean , it have two pool and it be easy to get a cab",0,142
"sosa family cigar shop in downtown disney sale some of the best cigar available , even though they be a bit expensive here just like all other shop you can still find some good quality cigar here if you like to smoke them . personally i love cigar specially the smell of it , here they have a long selection of cigar and they keep them nice and moist and ready to be smoke right away . the employee here be friendly and knowledgeable and if you have something they don ' t have here they can find it for you . great place to buy cigar and then smoke it outside while watch people walk by sense you never know what you might see in down town disney . over all , three star for a good selection but pricey .",1,142
this hotel be the worst nightmare you can ever have while enjoy holiday . beware this be a graveyard . nothing be functional in this hotel . it be just the decency of the people which these people be take advantage of . there be 3 elevator in this 13 floor hotel and 2 of them do not work . when i check in the check in clerk add a resort fee which when i later complain to them they remove it say it be a mistake . the room be date to say the least . we have to call up every day to remind them about towel a they forget . we have to walk down 13 floor because the elevator come up be full and we have to catch the bus . nothing seem right in this resort .,0,142
"a disappointing stayin my experience marriott ' s be hit or miss . i haven ' t find a marriott chain that be a consistent a any of the hilton chain . with that say , this be one of those marriott ' s that be a miss . this place be build in 2002 with renovation do in 2009. i expect something fairly modern and clean , however it be neither of those thing . everything in this hotel just look dated and have an unkept smell and look inside . on the plus side , you do get a full kitchen , small continental breakfast , and free wifi . if you ' re someone look for a quick night stay at a budget price this could be a good stop . extended stay i would suggest look elsewhere .",0,142
"yuck ! i be in room 109 , not that it matter . . . all the room pretty much sound the same . there be blood and mystery stain on the carpet , mold on the bathroom door , the whole place smell like cat pee , and the clientele be yell and party around me , scream at me off the balcony when i go to check out at 5 be . my boyfriend and i usually go for the bargain motel , since we only really need a place to sleep for the night and not much else . but this place be the grossest thing we ' ve lay eye on so far . the only good thing , be the sheet seem to be clean and i didn ' t see any evidence of bedbug .",0,141
"hotel be nice and clean , but at the time of my stay most of the hotel be under construction . the room that myself and coworkers receive be very noisy all day long . rather than block off the room near construction they let people stay in them know it win ' t be great experience . also if you have kid half of the pool area be close right now for construction . finally our group go to the white horse sport bar inside the hotel for the game , and come to find out they don ' t even serve food there . they have a limited room service menu . this could very well be a nice hotel perhaps i come at a bad time . win ' t be try this one next time though .",0,141
"this be a typical hampton inn - - which be a good thing . very adequate hotel , without be fancy . the room be nice and the bedding be very good . the furniture and decor be nothing special . everything be clean . the breakfast be better than some , and i like the mickey mouse shape make- your- own waffle . a nice touch . the hotel be pretty easy access to all park . you don ' t have to go out to i- 4. however , traffic can be bad to get here at the end of the day . that be the nature of the beast . all in all , a good place to stay if you be do to disney . also , a bargain if you be cash in hhonors point .",1,141
"this be a nice place . i come here for a conference and be pleasantly surprise by the very comfortable room we have ( with wet bar ) , coffee bean coffee in the room . excellent free wifi service throughout the resort . close to numerous restaurant and bar especially if you take the trolley . staff be friendly . join glen at the sonoma bar he be delightful . the serenity pool be nearly empty and our last day we spend a few hour in the afternoon there . nice mellow music but the gardener be use all their power tool which kind of throw off the serene vibe . my only disappointment be the lack of alligator ( a in not even 1 ) on the property , i really want to see one on this trip .",1,141
what be wrong with marriott hotel ? this be the second one in le than a month that have maintenance problem . this one have a leaky toilet so when we flush the ground be wet and the next time one go in one ' s foot be wet . when i tell the front desk she say she will send the maid up to fix it . this may be the problem - have maid instead of plumber fix plumb leak . the maid say she can not fix the leak . on top of that the side door don ' t work so one have to walk all the way around to the front after park in the rear . this be very disappointing . we stay at the marriott because we trust they manage a working hotel .,0,141
"i go to a conference here every year , and a conference hotel go , it ok. i don ' t think i ' ve ever eat at the hotel , which be a problem because the only thing close by be food poison sushi place or food poisoning burrito place . there ' s free coffee sometimes which be nice except they ' re usually out of sugar packet . two year ago it be rain really hard and i be on the verge of a nervous breakdown underneath that overhang outside the convention center . but then all these goose flew in and start eat the grass in the rain . it make me feel better . i take a picture and send it to my dad and he say he hat goose because they ruin the grass .",0,141
"this place be nasty ! if it wasn ' t one of the only hotel in that small city we would have stay elsewhere . the shower be very slick and so be the floor almost slip on both and the floor be not even wet . the shower leak all over the bathroom floor and be even more slick when it do get wet . the towel be old and very thin . i pull the blanket back and find brown spot all over the 2nd bed be not a bad but i still toss the top blanket off and use my own blanket and my own towel to stay warm . i be very happy that i bring my own blanket , towel and pillow . i try to get the wi- fi to work but that didnt happen",0,141

"husband and i have great stay while visit the disney park . comfortable room ; extra comfy bed and pillow ; everything felt clean ; bath & amp ; body work toiletry ; microwave/ fridge that ' s perfect for a few grocery or leftover ; responsive staff ; definitely walkable to downtown disney . we use the shuttle each day to get around , very easy to use . they come at least twice an hour ( i think ? ) , but we never have to wait long . while not disney- theme or necessarily luxurious , we be look for a good quality and somewhat budget- friendly hotel , because we know most of our time would be spend in the park anyway . we get what we hop for , and would definitely come again !",1,140
"we check in and the shower be run without be in the `` on '' position . it wouldn ' t stop , so they move u to a second room . the second room ' s trash can hold a previous guest ' s garbage . they send u to a third room . the next day , due to some confusion or incompetence , our room would not unlock . our belonging be inside , and we have no access . after try to explain this to the desk clerk , they send a maintenance worker to let u in . the hotel be surround by a highway , bright electric billboard , and an otherwise charming pack of feral stray cat . next time we visit disney , we ' ll stay at a different hotel .",0,140

"i ' ve stay here numerous time for the annual panama canal society reunion and i really like this property . the room be okay , you know run of the mill marriott , decent , clean , comfortable , not shabby . the rest of the property be great for this type of large scale , multiday event . the on premise restaurant make it so you don ' t really have to leave the property . the pool be great , good service . the staff be a little overzealeous about security and have say that i have to add that we ' re a notoriously wild , large mob ! the bar staff here be really cool and hey , the starbucks in the lobby be my morning hangout . really close to disney too .",1,139

"i need a place to stay because our disney hotel reservation doesn ' t start until tomorrow . the rate be $ 98. not the cheapest but not bad for the area . my room be a 2 queen- bed room . it be not the most beautiful room i have ever stay at but the room be clean and have two comfy bed . they give u ticket for the complimentary breakfast from 6- 9. . . kind of early for vacationer but oh well . there be a pool but it be 50 degree so i will not be use that option . it be an outside pool . we have a microwave , mini fridge , safe , and wifi . the attendant be friendly at check- in . close to restaurant and souvenir shop .",1,139
i like this hotel . i be a little worried about all the review i read but decide to go ahead and get the room anyways . first the room we stay in didn ' t have any bug . we check closely before we bring in our bag . order the sheet and the mattres . second the staff be very accommodate and even upgrade or room because they have an opening . the water park be great for kid up to ten year old . the food be ok. my only issue be the hour that the watermark be open . 11 to 7. i ' m not sure why people be try to down them but either they have unrealistic expectation or they work for some other resort in the area that caters to kid .,1,139
the enclave hotel be by far the dirtiest place i have ever stay . i actually gag the first time i get in the elevator . we call to the `` smell- evator '' . the carpet be saturate with what smell like human waste . the room itself be run down but not terrible . the tub didn ' t drain well and none of the light switch work but it didn ' t stink at least . the bedding be so old it probably consist of mostly dust mite at this point . we be only in the room to sleep and stay far away from the property the rest of the time . the staff be friendly and i feel bad for them to have to try to put a positive spin on that dump .,0,139
"an okay place . it ' s not a high- end hilton but the room be clean , the bed be comfortable ( if you like firm mattress ) and the bedding be soft without that starchy feel . the small refrigerator and microwave in the room be a nice addition . it ' s within walk distance of at least three restaurant . the internet work , the room coffee be not- so- great , but the morning breakfast be better than most , especially with the make to order option . overall it ' s a good value for the money . the front desk staff have also be polite , helpful , and willing to answer your question without a lot of eye- rolling , barely- restrain indifference . that ' s always welcome .",0,138
"don ' t let the lovely look of the room fool you - this hotel blow ! first all , the sleep number bed be of the devil . no matter the number they be super uncomfortable . secondly , the ac be set to where you can turn it lower - which be necessary since it be hotter than the surface of the sun in orlando in july - but after a bit it turn back to 75 degree . lame ! also , when one of u leave to start load the car at 9 a. m. on our check- out day ( keep in mind , check- out be 11 a. m. ) , he couldn ' t get back in the room because they have deactivate the damn key ! worst experience ever !",0,138
"very clean , nice resort . checking in be a breeze . we check in late , so we never be approach about the timeshare that everyone have mention . there be a nice pool area , also have gas grill outside for grill . we stay in tower 2 , on the 8th floor . every night , we have a great view of the firework . for a family of five this be more than enough room for u . allow u not to be all on one another , like we would be at a hotel , it be like a mini apartment for probably le than what a hotel would have cost u . there be no room service , so be prepare to clean behind yourselves . i would definite stay again .",1,138
"when stop at night ( it be only 9pm ) , be aware that half of the restroom be block off . both of the family restroom ( which we need to use ) be lock . no security in sight . the half of the restroom which be open be not well lit ; it be pretty dark in there . have my husband not have be with me , i would have never go in . not a very safe place at night . i ' d recommend wait and stop at an exit with a gas station . they do have quite a few snack machine from soda , to snack , to even ice cream . this rest area be probably just fine during the daytime , but be extremely careful after dark !",0,138
"nice place , comfy and spacious nice size room , the king size suite be spacious . would have be nicer if the 2nd bedroom have an option of put twin bed together to make one big bed . there be a few thing wrong which be fix with one phone call to the front desk . hot tub by the pool be nice . pool adequate . drawback , not have daily maid service , for bed making and towel and light cleaning . you want that you have to pay a fee . also could not find one mail box anywhere . concierge have no mail receptacle and no information a to where we could find one . would i stay here again ? not sure know there be other place all over this area .",0,138
this be a very nice facility . i only have one minor complaint . front desk staff profile customer and give best room location to white customer . white privilege at it best . i ask for a top floor before i arrive . when i arrive the clerk give me a ground floor room . when i request a high floor again he give me the worst room location in the facility near an elevator and a view face dead tree . i go back a third time and get a better lake view room and high floor . remember when your skin color be dark you get the worst choice in room selection . you have to ask three time until they get it that you want the same preferences other human being most desire .,1,138
this hotel have pro and con the pro be a nice hotel for the rate we pay the room be clean they be undergo some remodel the door on the closet be fall off the hinge . front desk people be very nice the con they say free wifi if you can get it to work . also out side in the grass be dog poop and a bunch of litter all over the place . saturday night the bar be close when another room use the shower it ' s so loud in our room it sound like someone pound on the wall . if you be expect a lot don ' t you get what you pay for ! ! ! i wound have to say i don ' t think i would stay here again,0,138
this place be ok if you be here on business . if you be a family go on vacation i would go somewhere else . i travel every week on business and always stay at a hilton property . this place be a disappointment . it seem like the owner be try to barely comply with his contract with hilton . paper plate and cup . breakfast end at 930. they even turn off the light so you win ' t eat more . they be slow to restock food . our elevator be break the whole week that we be herethe hotel be 30 min from amusement park . the ride take an hour in rush hour traffic . i have have great experience at home wood suite . this owner be cheap and it show !,0,138
"excellent place to stay if visit the universal studio park . navigation to the park via the foot path or the water taxi be easy and enjoyable . no hassle with parking at the park and fight the crowd . the resort itself be very nice . well lay out and easy to navigate . we park our car after check in and didn ' t go back to it all week until we depart . check in and check out process and housekeep service be flawless during our stay . the italian bistro on property be excellent . great original recipe pizza and sandwhiches . we didn ' t try the high end northern italian restaurant , but it look good . great pool that the kid really enjoy . highly recommend this loews ' property .",1,138
"this be the first of three hotel we stay at . i be a fan of this place . the lobby area be nice . the room be pleasantly decorate . they have sleep number bed . we have a room with bed that come out to the bed . they have free wifi ! ! that be a huge plus . the only thing i can complain about be that the sink with the bowl . that be cause i be short . it be locate close to the park and we be able to get to everything we need . my kid keep ask to come back here after we leave until we get on to disney property . they do have free park too . however , they do have a rigid cancellation policy .",1,138

"it ' s a gorgeous property , great customer service , nice room , and bright fun decor that isn ' t garish . don ' t get a room on floor 1- 10 , they all seem to be by the plumbing etc for the pool and they ' re noisy . the food available in all these place be expensive , and mediocre . i suggest if you want to pay a minimum of $ 20 per meal you go next door to the waldorf astoria . the pool be super , heat , they have a lazy lagoon thing you can float around and a water slide , downside be that it full of kid . you can access all the waldorf astoria stuff . just a note the waldorf pool be not heat .",1,138

"i have to stay at this hotel for 2 month for a job down here in orlando and i couldn ' t be happier with the service . everyone from management to front desk to house keep have a smile on their face and be more than willing to help with any request . free breakfast 7 day a week be great . even better be free dinner monday- thursday with a small but very fresh salad bar . even better still be their free shuttle which will drive you anywhere in a 3 mile radius . all facility include lobby , room , and gym be extremely clean and up to date . be away from home for that long blow but this hotel make the experience more than bearable .",1,132
"this place be clean and have convenient transportation to all the disney park , hence the two star . staff be friendly . but overall , this resort be overprice and lousy . our room smell damp and musty , like a gym locker room , and have two broken lamp , a clogged drain in the shower ( ew ! ) and there be not a single place to recycle here . super wasteful ! food price be through the roof ( oatmeal be $ 6 , a single waffle be $ 7 . 50 , a pre make salad be $ 12- $ 16 ) for sub par food . we recommend the buffet style ( not ready make ) food at picabu buffeteria for the best value meal .",0,132
"room perfect ! resort pool wonderful ! house keep drop the ball during our 3 night stay . we be generally out of the room each day by 10am . the first day , our room be service , but we have no towel , toilet paper or tissue ? we call house keep . . . in the end , i go on a search for a house keep cart on another floor . second day ? no service at all ? we come back to the room at 530pm , call house keep and be tell service stop at 5pm ? ! ? we never get service anytime before 5pm ? ! ? also , why do every resort bus we take have no ac ? ! ? horrible !",1,132

"i stay here 2 year ago with my family . our age be ( at the time ) 14 , 18 , 47 , and 45. the room we have be amazingly comfortable , and be a suite , which make it even better . we be barely in our hotel though , because we stay go to disney world . pro : comfortable , nice front desk , good breakfast , great view , suite , and affordable . con : the route can be a long one if you get stick in the disney rush until i- 4. other than that , no con ! enjoy the stay ! also , don ' t stay there if you aren ' t go to disney world . enjoy disney though !",1,132
"stinky hotel . . my bos book our business trip , which be not a good thing . . he doesn ' t do any research on hotel before book them so sometime we get really good hotel like the rosin down the street or crappy hotel like this one . i be currently stay in the hotel and i have the window up so i can get some fresh air up in this stinky room . the room have that really old hotel smell . . the bathroom be filthy , the bathtub be dirty with blue mildew on the tub . i would not recommend this hotel unless all the hotel in orlando be full . 3 night . . it ' s gon na be 3 lonnng one .",0,132
"it ' s disney . how can you not give it a good rating . we get there when it open , so we get to walk onto ride . you can now get princess and mickey ' s signature right when you walk into the park . i have only 2 negative thing to say : 1 ) pirate of the carabbean be break all day . i know that you should be able to ask anyone at any of the food location to get an update . i ask multiple time and be tell it be back up and work . i would race over to find out that it be still break . bummer ! 2 ) donald and daisy be no where in sight for signature .",1,131
nice hotel . come for universal and they have a shuttle to take you to and from . when i call the front desk to ask about the shuttle they say not everyone can get on and you have to have a ticket so be downstairs to reserve a seat by 7am . . . so my husband and i decide to drive to universal instead of deal with the hassle . the room be nice and clean and the pool be nice with a bar . we call to see if we could check out an hour later and say if we do there would be an extra charge . . . every other hotel i ' ve ever ask for a late check out always allow for free .,0,131

"look , we all know full well that you ' re not look for luxury when you ' re consider stay here . it ' s a best western . at $ 68 a night , you get what you pay for . the only reason we stay here be it proximity to universal ( only a mile away ) and because our bank account be already hurt from all the ticket to the theme park . if you want clean- enough ( which by this i mean no bed bug or anything else vile ) budget accommodation close to universal and other orlando attraction , then this be a fine option . oh , and take the stair . the elevator be act up when i stay here .",0,130
"this hotel be beyond fantastic . we be there for four night and everyday we do something different . our room overlook the pool and lake . . very pretty and unobstructed view . the staff be fantastic and they go above and beyond . it be a massive hotel and we be look for the shop inside the hotel . we be ask by a very friendly man if we need any help . when we tell him what we be look for , he walk u there instead of just point to tell u where to go . our favorite place to lounge be the bleu bar . it be a very lay back atmosphere and the bartender be awesome . we will definitely go again !",1,129

"this hotel be right in the middle of tourist area with heavy traffic , but be close to my corporate office so i decide to give it a try . the hotel interior be clean , room update , bed comfortable and the corner suite be worth the extra cost for the size of the room . i enjoy the even reception from 5 : 30 to 7 : 30 with a good assortment of finger food and free drink . there be a good variety of restaurant within walk distance and one be open until 2am for that late night snack . staff be very friendly and assist with any request promptly . i will be sure to stay there again next time im in the area .",1,129

"i stay here for a work meeting for an entire week . the hotel have a huge atrium and the staff be excellent . i have a king suite on the 10th floor and it be outstanding with a wonderful view ( ask for one with a balcony ) . the food be good but not great , however , i be not disappointed with it at all . i do not get to go in the pool , but it be large and many people be enjoy it . sea world be across the street - look for online special with this hotel and sea world to save a few buck ( my friend tell me this ) . i would stay here if i come back .",1,129
we stay at this hotel almost every time we go to orlando for outlet shopping and we don ' t want to spend a lot in a one night stay . the room be always clean and the breakfast be nice . we be mariott elite member so we don ' t have any problem get a seat in the breakfast area . the only downside be the traffic . it ' s so near the premium outlet and downtown disney that sometimes traffic in the area be kind of a nightmare . we be use to it and always leave the room early just in case . but if you be look for a clean and inexpensive hotel room well situate this be a good choice .,1,128

"when this place be first design , i bet the people want to design a classiest and best resort/ convention center in orlando . it seem that when they build the place , they seem to cut corner and in the end result , the place do look a bit cheap at time . also , a big boo to the glass bottle nazi in the outside area . i know glass bottle be not usually acceptable poolside , but my bottled beer be nowhere near the pool . i ' d actually have to chuck the bottle pretty hard to even have a chance of hit the pool . so please , leave me and my bottled beer alone . thanks .",1,123

"we have a nice stay here . the location be excellent and i really like the integration of the resort with the magicbands . the restaurant be just ok. we go to the yachtsman on a stormy night after we be wash out from the theme park . the ambience be family friendly and the food choice for the kid be solid . nothing stand out a exceptional . one dish that come to mind be the scallop . this appetizer come with three scallop , which be hardly a generous portion for a family to share . similarly , gnocchi be good , but not great . i would expect better food from a restaurant that easily top $ 200 .",1,122
"lovely hotel at universal studio . water taxi connect the park plus free fast pas make our park experience super . the guy at the dock be amaze and super helpful . kid friendly hotel . quieter than royal pacific and hard rock , my son and i really enjoy our stay here . beach pool be perfect for a non theme park afternoon . sip cocktail , read a book while watch my son enjoy the pool be awesome . good toiletry , average pillow but comfortable mattress , ok breakfast . . nothing outstanding except for their fresh squeeze orange juice . generally decent service . i feel it ' s a good deal . will come back again .",1,122

"the staff be incredibly nice , very spacious room but very dirty feeling/ outdated : ( the mattress be stain we could see through the sheet and the white thick blanket be stain yellow and black if you look in the light . i felt a bit itchy and didn ' t wan na say anything to my family because i choose the hotel and pay for the `` deluxe '' room then my sister wake up with bite everywhere . this would ' ve be the perfect hotel because the room be very big and come with a microwave , fridge , nice tv and alot of towel . they also give free water in the lobby and room .",0,121
"i stay here over during my trip to orlando for 4 day and i get ta say it ' s pretty good . full kitchen with marble island , the master bedroom have double shower head , washer / dryer combo and a convertible sofa . the resort also have their own cab service to take you to the park but you will have to pay for the taxi/ shuttle fee at the park ( not sure about universal , this only happen when we go to disneyworld ) . the only thing i wasn ' t happy about be the wi- fi connection inside . it ' s strong in the hotel lobby but super weak in individual room .",1,121
"i be in orlando for foot surgery and this be what rci find for a 3 week stretch . the location ( not near the medical area ) have me concern at first , but i come to enjoy a different side of orlando than the convention area i be use to . i be pleased enough with the service from the staff , the cleanliness , the ambience , etc . that i purchase a time share there via ebay . an indoor pool for use during winter month and a restaurant on site with a broader menu would be nice , but overall , the place more than meet my need - i be pleasantly surprised and content .",1,121
if you ' re here on business this place be good . close to the airport . nice look pool with change mood light . friendly staff . and they be in the process of update the bar area . the drawback : you ' re close to the airport and therefore far away from everywhere else of interest in the orlando area . there be weak food selection in the lobby after the coffee shop and sundry shop close ( after 2 pm ) . best bet be the freakin ' snack machine ? ! ? really ? at a full service marriott ? it ' ll do . . . i ' m here for work after all .,1,121
goodcheck in be great and the manager joke around with me . so we get to the room and the bed be kinda comfy . ( at least i could sleep on it ! ) and they put soft pillow in the front and firm pillow in the back . they also have laundry there . they do have a pool with a slide and a waterfall so that be good . i spend my whole time at the pool go down this slide . the hotel be also a disney good nighbor hotel . badnot much . the pool be very cold .

"the suite we have at homewood suite in orlando be clean , comfortable and spacious and the kitchenette well equipped . the breakfast be typically american with disposable plate and cutlery which i al a european be not a big fan of . the food itself be not bad and the selection really good - probably the best we have on our entire trip . the complementary microwave popcorn that be available all day at the rezeption be a nice gesture . staff be always very friendly and helpful . i also really like the heated pool and jacuzzi . the hotel have a very convenient location at the international drive with many restaurant in walk distance . thumb up !",1,121
"the room be clean . that ' s pretty much all the praise i can muster . to be fair , to give context , the hotel be in the middle of a renovation ( january 2012 ) but perhaps that be all the more reason to : give better customer service ( do not receive ) and additional perk ( you make me cross the busy highway to get dunkin donut ? ) . i ' m spg platinum but we book under my gf ' s gold status a she have extra point to spare . i be not sure if i would ' ve gotten any preferential treatment but we be never ever go to find out .",0,121

do not go here ! the picture and website be to lure you in . i still do not understand why it be label a resort . we be so disappointed when our shuttle pull up to this . it be run down . my daughter lean on the bar in the elevator and it fell down . the entire place be old and dirty . i do not want to sleep here even though it be for just one night . this place should be close or seriously remodel . they have a nice pool area and that be it . you can find lot of nice hotel for the same price . avoid this place if you can .,0,121
"be completely impressed with every facet of my stay . spend 3 full day on site for training ( work out , ate , slept , live ) in the hotel without see daylight for 3 day to be exact . restaurant be great , pricing be fair . meeting room in my case be quite comfortable and well stock . you have access to starbucks , shop , spc . on the main concourse floor which be easy to access by escalator . receive quick response to all of my request , top notch service in all area , spacious room , great overall experience . would return . almost forgot , best breakfast buffet ever ! great selection .",1,121
"i wish i would have read the review before we stay there . i have stay in a lot of embassy suite all over and i have certain expectation a to what you get when you stay at one . this one be dirty , the people work the reception area be far from helpful and would just stare at the computer screen instead of help you , and if you be stay there for a trip to disney world , you will be disappoint . the shuttle to disney be few and far between , i guess i expect at least hourly trip back and forth whereas there be only a few . definitely would not recommend stay there .",0,121
"first , the restaurant in very difficult to find since it ' s bury in the bottom of the hotel . try to call them for over an hour in order to get direction but they do not answer the phone ' s. when we finally arrive , they ask for our name and if we have a reservation . explain that we have be try to call for over an hour and nobody answer the phone . they say the phone must be break . restaurant be very dark inside and very quiet . food be ok but not worth the price . next time i will go to downtown disney and try wolfgang puck ' s place instead .",0,121

"this review be for the water park only . it be an ok place to spend 4 hour cool off in the water . i get an amazon social deal which be half off the regular price of admission into the water park . i be not sure i ' d pay the full admission price for our family of 5 , but definitely it be a great deal for half off . note that it be very crowd in july and even though we get to the water park just before it open at 11am , it be still busy and we have to wait in line to go on the bigger tube ride .",0,116
"positive - easy to get to , great bed , good ac , nice restaurantsnegatives - valet parking take forever , room service menu be limit , club room snack be nothing special , 1 , 000 kid run around for something call pro- scout . the park situation really ding this hotel , we have to wait over 30 min on saturday to get our car to drive to a wedding and barely make it . also , the club room be nothing special in addition to run out of the food they do put out and explain there be no way to get more . next time in town , stay at the ritz",0,116

"we make the mistake of agree to a 2- hour sale pitch here . scary how sleazy it be . try to shame you into an on- the- spot financial decision base on a high pressure sale pitch . after 2 hour , and a polite decline from u , they be not go to let u leave . we literally have to stand up and be rude to be set free . elizabeth warren be elect to protect innocent consumer from this kind of fraud . our advice : buy an index fund and save your money ! the only winner in this deal be the commissioned salesperson . shame on you intercontinental resort .",0,116
this be a mssive convention hotel that be in dire need of a face lift . surrouding be grand and beautiful but once you step into your room i hat it . the furniture have probably be in the room since the hotel inception and the stain be there to prove it . the bed be le than comfortable and the bedding be old and horrible . i have to have the maid service come in change the sheet because of several stain on the bed spread . the maid service be great and do what they can . decent food be available 24 hr a day . i would steer clear of this place .,0,116

"this place be very nice . i be expect much le for the price we pay , but my expectation be exceed . the staff be very friendly and the service be prompt . i definitely recommend the bar and grille for superb service . the gentleman who work there be very very good at his job . the room and pool go above expectation for the cost . my only complaint be the breakfast buffet . the food be awful and not worth the cost . again , all other food on site be great , but i would skip the breakfast . overall , very nice . i would definitely stay again .",1,115
"well , i book a reservation with this hotel a week ago and i have to say i be not impressed ! for personal reason we have to cancel our reservation . however , our cc be bill ! we book through . but we do send them an email and they seem unable to help u secure a refund . despite leave several message for the general manager at the hotel and email , nobody seem to have any idea of how to accommodate u . save yourself the trouble and book somewhere else where there be better communication and a more attentive staff ! ! ! very frustrated & amp ; angry !",0,115

it great to have a washer and dryer in the room . save time on pack and more like able to bring bag on a carry on a oppose to check stuff in . be sure to stop by wal- mart or publix before or shortly after get in . it just a short 5- 10 minute ride away . gas be also cheaper over in this section a oppose closer to the disney resort . keep in mind that it be a vacation ownership location and you may get call about try to purchase something . we own and will be take the wife to hawaii later in the year a a result .,1,115

"i would rate this property in the 2 . 5 range . this be base on the embassy suit standard and not on the other hotel in the area . for the hotel have see better day and the room need to be update . the breakfast and reception be still good perk . location be one of the best in orlando , with easy on and off of i- 4 , plus crane roost park right in the front . of the option in altamonte spring , this be still my first choice , but of those in orlando , if the rate be good , i would do the sheraton maitland instead .",0,115
"this hotel be convenient to the convention center . i have no choice but to attend a business convention with my husband because there be not one thing to do near the hotel . when we check in there be no bellhop . i think that be unusual . this be one of those hotel that limit toilet paper and the dispenser be locate behind the toilet . we just take the roll off and put it in a more convenient location . when we request a late check- out , the young lady tell u it would be a $ 25 charge . crazy . it ' s a hotel , nothing outstanding .",1,115

"ok hotel . decent for the rate . communication issue with housekeep meant we end up have no cleaning for several day . find a bug in the room , but that do happen in florida . smoking room be stuffy even for a smoking room , air conditioning turn off midway through the night every night . when it be on , the area smell of mold . filter need change . staff be overall kind but somewhat difficult to communicate with ( not a language barrier , just a communication issue ) - you definitely get what you pay for , and for what be pay , it be a good deal .",0,115
"beautiful ground , landscaping , and facility . very clean room and fitness center . our room be fairly large by ritz standard . our room overlook the golf course and there be a lovely balcony with patio furniture . the pool and the lazy river be awesome ! we pretty much spend our day by the pool . service be friendly , very helpful , and accommodate . they be so thoughtful to bring in some snack and cute toy for my kid to our room minute after we checked- in . the experience for my kid be worth every $ $ $ $ spend just to see the look on their face .",1,115

"i be a bit worried about stay in this hotel after read all the negative review , but i do not have a bad experience . room be clean and bed be comfortable . the bathroom floor be a bit dirty and it be strange that there be foam sticker on the towel , kind of childish lol . another thing be that the breakfast really isn ' t up to par with other embassy suite . the french toast and pancake be flavorless and there isn ' t much variety with anything . you ' re better off go to denny ' s or starbucks around there . staff be nice and accommodate .",1,115
"decent dig , basic accommodation , but an extra star for free wifi and a great breakfast buffet ! they have a nice coffee bar , a fridge of microwaveable sausage sandwich and the like , waffle , the standard bagel/ pastry/ hot stuff bit , and nice fridge with yogurt and individually package grapefruit , which be definitely a win . much better than the standard continental breakfast buffet . all in all , a cheap , easy , simple offer - don ' t come expect a charm kitchey hotel , but a plain and straightforward experience , great for have a place to crash after a long day at the park .",1,115
"we just return from a 3 day weekend in orlando , stay at the all star movie resort . vacation be nice but the stupidest idea i have ever see be this new `` magic band '' for fast pas . it great for hotel purpose , din plan and ever purchasing but for the easiest of all . . . `` fast pass '' it just suck ! we end up request a card for our fast past and just do it the old way , disney i hope you fix this fast pas crap soon i wont be try them out for my park pas or the fast pas anytime soon !",1,114

"ehh . . spent four night here and i be not wow at all . we come in to a room that clearly wasn ' t properly clean . when we take a shower it make a terrible screeching noise if the water be hot , a nice balcony that be not private with a terrible view . a fridge but no microwave . over price , decent breakfast buffet with not so friendly server . some day we wouldnt have new towel , a mat for the bathroom , anything that need to be restock . pool be beautiful and completely empty . fitness room be great . the bed be very comfortable",0,114
"it ' s the best collection of park pretty much on the planet . it ' s fun for kid and adult . my only advice be if your kid be really little ( under 4 ) don ' t waste your time or money . they be too small to really care about the $ 2500 you spend come here , so save yourself the time and money and just buy them some dumb ol ' dora the explorer dvd and let them watch that like 100 time . you know they have the memory of a goldfish anyway so they ' ll watch that thing over and over and never complain .",1,114
"room be big and nice and comfortable . but the service suck . the guy at the for desk be rude . when i call to order food from the restaurant he say he have no idea when he ' d be able to get to that because he be busy do our task . he also refuse to bring the food up to the room and say i ' d have to come to get it myself , which i have no problem do so but i didn ' t appreciate his tone of voice . when i go to get the food , he mess up he order . be frustrate .",0,114

"we get in kissimmee late and decide we ' d just get a room for 1 night and look for the best rate and accommodation later . it turn out this place be clean and very affordable . the room , wall and corner be clean . the bathroom be clean and look like it be recently paint and tile . the staff be friendly and helpful when i need info . i think we lucked up and find a nice place . i will definitely stay there again . i only saw room 302 , it be a good room . i suggest you check out their website for more info .",1,113
"this place have paper thin wall . it ' s not bad if the folk on either side a well a above be quiet , but if you want to get some sleep before go to the airport the next day , you ' re roll the dice . it ' s an older marriott with a restaurant and bar . the pool look nice , and the gym be good . the price for the room seem reasonable , but the price of parking do not . overall it wasn ' t worth it to me because i could have get similarly poor quality if sleep elsewhere for half the cost .",0,113
"this place be disgust . it ' s not actually an `` inn '' but really a `` motel '' . the bathroom be dirty and i felt like i need to wear flip flop around the room . there be an insect on my bed when i get here ( luckily not bed bug ) but i ' m not surprised because these room open to outside . don ' t expect a lot of amenity although the pool weren ' t half bad . the area be good , but so be the other hotel . it would be worth the upgrade to another rosen or the gorgeous hyatt nearby .",0,113
"we have a pleasant experience stay here . we didn ' t need housekeep , we want to prepare meal and we just basically want to relax and make it feel like a home for over a week of stay . we get a corner suite , face the pool , close to the stair and exit door to the parking lot . it be so convenient to what we need for our vacation that we will look for other esa branch for our next trip . the breakfast they have for free be not worth wake up for , so just make your own in your unit at your own time .",1,113
"stay here one night last week when my mother get very sick at downtown disney and could not drive home ( yes we be local ) . i pay $ 29 at and it would be just fine at even double that price . the property be about a mile from downtown disney , the room be clean , and the property have a nice pool/ gym free parking and free light continental breakfast . if i be a tourist look for a bargain , id be very happy here . the front desk staff also go way way way out of his way to help me , and that be apprieciated .",1,113
"be a decent marriott . comfortable room . decent service . food at hotel restaurant luxe be over price but be good ( filet mignon , garlic mash potato ) . hotel concierge set me up with a `` taxi '' with no meter , a limo ( lincoln ) but be dirty , and a bit overpriced . take yellow cab next day by call myself and get a much cleaner le expensive ride in a cab that be already cool off . irk that my at & amp ; t iphone do not have free service on the at & amp ; t wifi here like it do everywhere else .",0,113

the massage i get with a groupon be very good but i have to give 1 sta because during the checkout process i be charge twice for gratuity . they charge a service charge which be the gratuity and then an additional gratuity that i do not authorize . then they need someone else to fix this . i think it be a one time mistake but by look at the review on trip advisor it seem this be a common occurrence and that have not be fix therefore do on purpose . beware . . . . i would have go back and use their spa again if they be honest .,0,113
great location within 15 minute of almost all attraction . this be an extremely opulent property . the lobby and ground be amaze . the room be very nice but not spectacular . ( that ' s why 4/ 5 star ) the lazy river be great . also since it ' s connect to the ritz carlton the spa and gym be very nice . like any orlando hotel there be a resort fee and also park fee . a a marriot elite you can get free self parking a your check in `` gift `` the lobby bar be nice and so be the restaurant but they be resort price .,1,113
"second time here . actually like it better this time . one odd think i note , when return each time from the bus after be at the park , the bus stop where kinda dark and scary at night . i would leave before my kid . i have a blood condition and tire easily . i felt uneasy walk back to the room . very quiet behind the hotel and very dark . also the parking lot where like a ghost town . no car park in them . just think it be weird . i know it disney , but anyone can drive into the hotel complex at anytime .",0,113
"we stay there for a family disney vacation . it be a great location and the room be newly update and beautiful . we pay an extra $ 15 a day for wifi and breakfast . there be a shuttle to the park , but sometimes they be late , which make it a bit more challenging with a small kid . it ' s walk distance to downtown disney ( a pleasant walk too ) . the only thing that be a tad annoying be the upsells . anytime we have a question , they would try to sell u something . overall , great place and would go there again .",1,113
"wow ! what a nice place ! stay there 3 night and be absolutely pleased with everything . the room be superb with a high level of comfort and luxury . the bed be heavenly . bathroom , shower , towel and amenity be all top noch . the staff be very helpful and be always smile and greating you whenever you walk by . the only so- so note would be the food at the main cafe . eat there 2 time for lunch and both time be very disapointing . but a short drive out the complex you have a lot of restaurant to choose fromwould definitively go back !",1,112
"long story short , never stay here . girlfriend have an allergic reaction to a drink , have to go to er after severe anaphylaxis . manager tim didn ' t believe me and laugh about the situation . he then threaten to call the cop after i get mad for such a horrible reaction to the situation . meanwhile , not only be the management the worst i ' ve ever have to deal with , there be blood on the sheet and housekeep only make the bed but do not change them . look somewhere else to stay . seriously . they ' re a lawsuit wait to happen .",0,112
"great resort , great room , clean , shuttle be very convenient if you will be visit the disney park . if you plan on spend all day at the disney park it be not worth stay here not worth pay the resort fee and not be able to use the pool or game room due to spend all day at the park . daily park fee be ridiculous and resort fee be also if you don ' t plan on spend all day at the hotel . ohh yea no microwave in room only fridge if you want a microwave it 10 buck extra a day . no free breakfast .",1,112
"i have a great stay here . the room be nice , and large , and clean . room service be a bit slow and confused . i don ' t like not have a stocked mini bar - i think the package you could request be cute , but when i get in and would just love to grab a snack or a drink because i ' ve be on a plane all day , i ' m bum when there isn ' t anything available . i would definitely recommend it , and they have ton of great meeting space available if you ' re look for meet venue .",1,112
"six night . . . . pricey but such a welcome change from disney hotel that it be worth it . parking be pricey but if you go down 1 blk . towards park ave. you can get park for $ 5 for 24 hr . staff be pleasant , room be 1 star le than perfect , location be within walk distance to dining and shoping and if you want to stroll , head to the coop for breakfeast ~ down to earth , family style seating and the breakfeast be amaze . definitely , when i head back to winter park , the alfond inn will do very nicely .",1,112

"this place be `` interestingly horrible '' for a lack of a better word . we book this resort for a week and do not know that this place do not provide any type of room service . we call to see if they can stock some bath tissue in our restroom and the front desk tell u this be a place where you be suppose to bring your own supply . we be like , wtf ! i would understand if it ' s byob , but not byos . would not recommend this resort . this resort be old but love the convenience to all the theme park .",0,111
"i love the bed here . they be super comfy and there be no doubt that they be clean ( which , sadly , be not the case with those icky over- bed- cover thingies at some place ) . the drawback ? no decent tv and they charge you for in- room internet access . also , the restaurant be pricey , but it ' s the hilton , so be i really that surprise ? no . all in all , very friendly service , great water pressure , lot of bathroom counter space , and easy to sleep in . i ' d book here again .",1,110
"nothing fancy but very convenient ! ten or so minute walk to universal studio , tgi friday across the street , walgreen ' s share the parking lot , 7- 11 and fast food a short walk , and a few in house place ( bar , restaurant , gift shop , starbucks ) . pool with a bar outside and a big hit tub . laundry facility with an arcade to keep you occupy while wait . no fan in bathroom . the staff have all be very friendly and helpful . not a single usb port in the room so don ' t forget your wall charger .",1,110
"the good thing about this hotel be it location . i have stay there 5 time now and it always the same . the front staff seem high on something , if you want a good laugh ask for an iron and iron board . you ' ll get one but you will be afraid to use it . the place smell like an old clarinet case . the bathroom and shower feel like a tomb . the price be good but still a bit high for what you get . all this say i imagine i will still stay there . . why ? because of the location .",0,110
"i be in love with this place ! maybe it ' s because i miss the time when everything be simple but it bring back childhood memory . i will never forget the smell of citrus and clean of this place . the cafeteria have the best food , even compare to the park restaurant , i prefer to head back to the hotel . the food be clean and refreshing , especially after eat all the junk in the park . the employee be super nice , helpful and happy . if i ever get there again , this will be the only place i ' d stay !",1,110
"the worst luxury hotel ever ! day 1 - no ac , no wi- fi . day 2 - no housekeeping , poor wi- fi . day 3 - bed make and towel leave but no toiletry or coffee refill , tub stop drain , cold shower . call to front desk each day - told manger would be inform and never hear back . heard other guest complain about wi- fi and find out complimentary wi- fi poor but if you pay an extra $ 14 . 95 it ' s suddenly great . staff be not always courteous . pool be nice ! i will never return .",0,110
"invite to attend hilton ' s presentation and stay here for three night in a studio . the room need some renovating , but overall be alright . the bed be a full size . . . egh . be most impressed by the amenity and the service . the pool , poolside activity , on- site movie theater , on- site deli , etc . be all great . i also appreciate the daily phone message from the activity director and other various staff update u and thank u for various thing . would stay there again , but would hope they would renovate the room by then .",0,110
i would recommend this hotel for business . vacation travel not so much . only because go to florida for vacation most of u like to play in the sun . the pool be okay but most the day the sun be block by the building . other than that the hotel be clean . front desk staff especially ashley be great and accommodate . i like that the fitness room be open 24 hour . bed be extremely comfortable . location seem safe enough . there be great shopping close by a well a easy access to major highway . 20 min to the orlando eye and disney .,1,110
"i wish there be two way that i could rate this hotel . for a family , it be great and i would give it high mark for cleanliness and for it amenity . the place be massive and have a lot to offer someone who be vacation . if you be look at it a a business class hotel which i would usually expect from double tree , i would rate it a the worst one i have ever stay in . the internet be so slow that it be useless . the attention to the thing a business person would not look for be simply not there .",0,110
pro : the hotel be what you would expect - motel 6 style layout . small but comfortable with a small fridge . housekeeping be good . transportation to each theme park be easy and close . wifi be free but useless - too slow . con : the food court be terrible ! long wait for crappy over price food ! 20 minute wait in line for a single $ 7 waffle then a 10 minute to pay for it . the problem be there be nothing else around here unless you want to wait in line for a bus to one of the theme park to eat .,1,110
"this be our first time stay at the caribbean beach resort and it be nice . the room be somewhat smaller than i remember any other disney hotel we ' ve stay at be , however the food in the cafeteria be good and the cleaning lady we have ( joyce ) be very kind and do a good job . and it be the biggest resort in disney world so expect to walk or catch an internal bus to get to place on the resort ! oh and the wi- fi be terrible . it keep cut in and out and didn ' t work half the time .",1,110
"we stay in the hotel portion of the resort . we select this resort because the room have balcony . we be very pleased with our selection . the room be clean , well maintain , and well appoint . the staff be friendly and accommodate . nice view of the golf course from the balcony . if you don ' t like the sound of golf cart and crack golf ball in the morning , make sure you mention that at check in . parking be difficult - not enough space , but there be option within a short walk . we would stay here again without question .",1,110
"place be cheap and clean enough . a my hubby say , `` at least the tv work '' . my only issue be how rude many of the staff be . i ' ve never encounter the poor attitude and lack of interest in provide even the most basic customer service a at the clarion ! some of the staff have be downright nasty . they also book u in a room that be already assign to someone else ! we walk into the room and realize another family be already stay there ! we get 2 breakfast coupon a an `` oops '' because of it .",0,109
"i love disney ! disneyworld be much bigger and better then disneyland . the size of the park do require some careful planning though . disney do a great job of transport one between park , but be advise the process do take time a they be a couple mile apart . main street be amazing , the castle view in the background be a must see . the staff at disney be overall very good and the environment be such a fun place to be ! if you have never be to disneyworld before , be sure to make it a place on your must visit list !",1,109

"beautiful hotel , amaze decor . . . love the service and the room . . . very close to park and well transport by water taxi free of charge courtesy of the hotel with the express pass just a great add on for free . . . . everyone very courteous and friendly . . . high quality of restaurant on site , gym , pool , lagoon . . . . a heavenly destination to relax and also enjoy the park . i go to island of adventure and universal studio and the convenience of go and come be such a nice experience . . . .",1,109
"the villa at this resort be great ! ! ! the villa we stay in fit 6 people comfortably , with two bedroom , two bathroom , a sleeper couch , full kitchen , washer and drier , etc . the ground be huge , and very nice . i would say the only con be that it isn ' t really close to anything ( restaurant , theme park , etc. ) , and they do not have any shuttle , so you need to either have a rental car , or have a lot of money for a taxi . overall , a great experience .",1,108
"whereas the hotel itself be nicely locate and have everything you expect for it price rance , i would not recommend stay there . we have several item steal from our room . while they do tell you to keep stuff lock away in the safe , you can ' t put everything in a tiny safe - besides , you do pay for a certain safety in your room . when i find out this be not an uncommon happening at the hotel , i decide that we ' d go for a disney hotel next time . and have be happy with that choice since .",0,108
"this be definitely the worst embassy suite i have ever be to . their customer service be practically non- existent because every time i ask them to bring something to my room they never bring it ! i guess they ' re use to have foreign tourist who don ' t really expect much , but the difference in customer service among this and other embassy suite be unbelievable ! also , their complimentary breakfast be horrendous ! every single thing they serve be of absolutely low quality ! the embassy suit in boca be much nicer and cleaner than this one so i be very disappointed !",0,108
"a an spg gold member , i travel quite often & amp ; usually four point i ' ve have great experience with . however , for some reason this facility do not seem to have any air circulate on any of the floor , all be humid & amp ; muggy/ sauna like even though weather outside be not that bad . wall be thing & amp ; there be constant noise in the hallway at night . shampoo/ conditioner seem like they be water down . self park very limited . check out and check into walt disney swan . . another starwood brand instead .",0,108
the place be a mess and the worst be that there be a total lack in customer service . word to the wise when the website say they have a shuttle to disney world that ' s true but it only run to magic kingdom and epcot and twice a day . trust me when i say if you be not early and wait for the shuttle you will miss the bus and no one give a hoot ! ! ! ! it ' s close to the park but too far to walk . better to spend the extra money and stay somewhere else for sure !,0,108
"i have not have the privilege of actually stay overnight at the waldorf , but i have a premonition that i would love it ! so beautiful ! the service be superb . i come for jazz in the lounge area , and have a great time ! if you want to come only to listen to jazz , you can have someone validate your ticket and only pay $ 5 for valet parking . the area be comfortable , and it ' s a great place to just walk around for a romantic night . . . i ' ll keep dream about the overnight stay !",1,108
"this hotel be clean and good for a one night stay . if i be stay lo ger i would probably go elsewhere . i saw complaint of contine tal breakfast but hey at least they have cereal , milk , pastry , juice , coffee , hard boil egg and waffle maker . so in other word i guess travelodge bring more breakfast choice . only thing missing be scramble egg lol . the staff be nice and efficient . so it all good . if i go visit my bro again for one night i ' d stay here ( it be only $ 49 )",0,108

say free wifi but you have to be in lobby to get can not connect in room have pool but have be close for two day now no mention if them do repair or work before hand during check in be tell when we go to the pool on day two they be close and would open the next day but when we go the next day be tell no they be not open again . claim to have a game room bur it be just their exercise room with outlet to plug in ipads and what not . with a few renovation could be a good hotel,0,108
ok so let me start i wasn ' t to happy to not receive a per request but they notice my concern and delt with it my overall experience be great they handle my concern very quickly in my situation i check in online so i didn ' t have to meet anyone just go straight to the room but with this option they should have leave a resort map in the room to know what the hotel offer that be pretty much my concern but everything else be great i would stay there again but then again i would pick another disney resort to experience another adventure,1,108
"really affordable , clean , helpful staff , and locate conveniently in the orlando area ! they have a pool but we didn ' t utilize it . parking be free , they have shuttle if you need a ride to most tourist attraction . complimentary breakfast in the morning ! ! i honestly felt i overpaid for this inn . it be really cheap and even though we only use it to stay the night it be worth more than the penny we pay a night to sleep here . and they have no problem move u room to room if we want a different view !",1,108
"great hotel property . the best hilton i have stay in for many year . they have it all go for them ; layout , service , shop , room , comfortable bed , restaurant , bar , amenity . awesome swimming pool and pool lounge area . restaurant be way above average for hotel restaurant . see my review for spencer ' s steakhouse . very happy employee which almost always lead to outrageous service . vital statstic ; $ 273 with tax for a room make this great place a little pricey . a steak dinner at spencer ' s will set you back also .",1,108
"i love that the room have `` hardwood '' floor , it feel so much cleaner than grimy old carpet . the bed be very very comfortable and the pillow be perfect . the best thing be the towels- they be plush and feel brand new . not like the typical over- wash and rough towel . i disagree with previous reviewer that the wall be thin , i don ' t hear anything and i ' ve be here a week . the negative , it far away from everything , so don ' t think you ' re go to walk to anything near by .",1,108
"be in town for orientation for ucf and need an affordable place to stay for a thursday . i be shock there aren ' t many place under $ 100 , even this far from all the theme park . this place be exactly what i need for my one night stay . fast check- in & amp ; out , really clean room , confortable bed , free wi- fi , really close to ucf campus , and free breakfast . if i need an overnight stay near ucf after i graduate , i ' ll keep this place on my list of place to stay .",1,108

"for the price , a very nice hotel conveniently locate across from universal studio . take their free shuttle to universal because although technically across the street it be well over a mile to the entry gate , the walk be not pedestrian- friendly and you will get plenty of exercise walking through the park . now back to the hotel : comfy bed , decent storage , and nicely sound- proofed make it easy to fall asleep and stay asleep regardless of how many family with cute , rambunctious kid be prance nearby .",1,95

"i visit the marriott for a conference . i choose not to stay here due to the outrageous cost . not only be the rate high , they hit you with a $ 22/ day resort fee and $ 18/ day to self park . i stay at a nearby hilton for half the cost . that be say , it do have a nice conference center . it be well lay out and accommodate our group of 3 , 000 people . the catered lunch be excellent .",0,89
"overall , this a lovely resort . the lobby , lobby bar , and our room all beautiful . the quench bar by the pool be great with outstanding service both in the bar and poolside . downside be it close really early . room service food at this resort be unusually good , get desert , awesome . all the staff here be amaze . but , internet access , which cost $ 10 daily suck ! and park for hotel guest be way too $ $ .",1,89

"if there be an option for 6 star , i ' d put down 6 star ! the service be impeccable , room service be quick , ambience be unbelievable and the ground be breathtaking . their concierge do all the work for you and their driver ' s be all very personable . i hat come home after stay here ! they live up to their name . . it ' s the waldorf , what do you expect ! ? we will definitely be come back !",1,89
"really ? people actually give the most magical place on earth bad review ? seriously . i have no word . i really don ' t do place on yelp but , i need to give credit to where credit be due . in my humble opinion . this be one of the greatest joy about be a floridian . truly , the most magical place on earth and that say a lot come from a unicorn . thank you disney ! my dream really do come true !",1,89
the ambiance of this establishment be an a+ . the lobby be gorgeous with a water fountain and lot of live foliage . the room be average but very clean . breakfast be mediocre but have a wide variety which be nice . the hotel be locate practically in crane roost park which be a great place to walk and enjoy the florida weather . the pool and hot tub be very small and very dirty ! ! ! ! ! that be definitely the biggest downfall .,0,88
"fairly big , no frill hotel , conveniently locate close to disney . basic everything : room , amenity , and service . no complaint , it may get a bit noisy when full , the wall seem to be exceptionally thin . be prepare to park far away if you arrive late - pretty standard hotel at a decent price . the bathroom be way too small for u standard , but by the same token , you be there to sleep and shower pretty much .",1,88
"we have an absolutely wonderful stay here . service from the valet , to the front desk to the pool side waitress ( who absolutely make our day ) we would highly recommend this hilton property to any family staying in the orlando areawhile it sort of look like a hospital from the outside , it have a great pool , with slide and lazy river . the pool side restaurant have great food and drink . 5 star which i never give to a hotel ! !",1,88

"for the money spend we felt underwhelmed with this place . $ 20 to park , $ 15 if you want a fridge , no hair dryer . we ask for a cot for our son twice and never get it . housekeep be bang on the door at 8am ! ! we go to halloween horror night so we be kinda tired ! ! ! we complain about never receive the cot and they knock off one day of park . wow . never again .",0,87

"we would stay here again without even consider other option . the room be spacious and comfortable for the price . the pool be great for the kid . the only downside be a quasi- long walk to downtown disney to catch the disney transportation , although the hotel offer it own share bus system we use a few time . we stay here for two week . we have a problem with our room and the hotel move u ( and our thing ) effortlessly .",1,87
"perfect for an over night stay in between flight or before a cruise . we have an inside room , overlook the airport . the noise , which sound like a white noise , be pretty much unnoticeable . there be computer with internet access , a decent pool and small fitness room . the attached restaurant wasn ' t very good , but not bad for a late night snack/ drink . the staff be very friendly . elevator be slow , and usually full .",1,87
"disney have reach a new low . while make billion from american visitor , disney be lay off american worker in favor of `` outsource '' to foreign company that bring in foreign worker a lower paid replacement . they be actually bring in foreign worker and sit them a desk in orlando previously occupy by american worker . plus , the american worker have to train their replacement before they be lay off ! ! not a very loyal corporate citizen , disney ! ! !",0,87
"get a great rate and lot of close restaurant to pick from , close to interstate on a nice tree line street . our room be large with two bed , great hd tv , nice late check out time ( 1200 ) . only downside for me be the tub/ shower combo , i like a true shower and not a step over into a tub . the room and rest of hotel be a lot cleaner than anything we stay in at cocoa beach .",0,87
"typical low budget disney area hotel . stick there because i book late for an orlando soccer tournament over the holiday . if you be ok with paper thin wall , loud kid and mile long breakfast line where cinnamon roll don ' t even get a chance to heat up they be garb so fast . . . this might be the place for you . add slow internet and analog tv . . . no thanks . it be in a decent location though .",0,87

hotel will not be confuse for a 4 star but i guess do the job if you be on a budget . the hotel be very close to universal and have many restaurant in walk distance . the manager that be on duty when i be there have a nasty attitude towards me and almost cause me to verbally destroy her . i wish i would have spend the extra money and stay at a nicer hotel .,1,78
impressive resort that have good hospitality by the staff . my wife and i be treat with respect throughout our whole visit . nothing but solid thing to say about the resort except the parking . the parking space near the room can fill up very quick leave you a long way to walk back to the room . the room be spacious and have all the essential for a week in orlando . very good resort .,1,78
this hotel be huge ! ! ! clean and very attentive staff . the restaurant serve very tasty food but a bite expensive . breakfast buffet be fill . the pool be like and ocean . there like 10 different one . . . lol the conference center and business center be setup for large event and all your company need . i highly recommend this hotel if you head to disney ! two thumb up !,1,77
"clean & amp ; spacious room at at moderate price for those qualify to stay . locate on disney property , but not own or operate by disney . guest may use wdw transit system and the monorail be conveniently locate at a disney own property across the street . wdw bus do stop in front of the hotel for transportation to various park - but not all . definitely my first choice when visit disneyworld .",1,77
"stay here for training and my room smell really bad . i ' m a sheltered person so i haven ' t have my share of holiday inn experience because i usually stay at 4+ star hotel , so i think my room smell be normal . i be wrong , my other coworkers say their room be fine . whoop , my bad . nice hotel , nice bartender , great service . 3 star .",1,77
"happiest place on earth ! you can easily spend a ton of money here , but you will be happy about it ! they have everything down to a science . the bus system for transport guest to and from the park and the wdw hotel , the underground trash system inside the park , and the forever- friendly staff be all so impressive . i will never be too old to come back to disney !",1,77
"hotel very dated , interior and exterior . room have an odor . lobby be update and nice however a gentleman work be somewhat rude and curt . he have a thick northern accent with dark hair and be not pleasant to interact with at all . i have a short stay but i don ' t think i will ever be visit again . overall not a great experience . great location to sea world .",0,77
"we have a great stay here . friendly staff , great room , free water taxi to and from city walk . the ground be beautiful , and you get into the park an hour before the general population . there be more kid here than portofino , but we never have an issue . the only negative be the pool music our first night there . apparently it play until the pool close at 11 .",1,77
"we stay at the the drury for 5 night while visit universal studio orlando . room be clean and service be great . breakfast and night time dinner be awesome . shuttle to the park fill up fast , so make sure to sign up early . good location for walk to various place to eat or shop . there be also an indoor / outdoor pool and spa great for the kid in the evening .",1,77

"really nice , spacious room and large double sink bathroom . furnishing well though out , nicely appoint . the price be kinda amazing , with the exception of the extra resort fee that pop up on the bill . so it go from only 99 ( amaze ) but after 25 valet and resort fee , it be more like $ 155. per night . well worth it , you can walk to sea world !",1,77
"this hotel be great if you want to get wake up all hour of the night by scream kid run up and down the hall . the restaurant be lousy and expensive . you be kinda isolated unless you have a car , a it be mile from other venue and there be not much local . i win ' t stay here again , but also have no desire to ever be in orlando again .",0,77
my wife and i love this place . we stay in build 6 to be close to the outlet mall . the pool be great and always enough chair . the staff be truly amazing . they all seem to really like their job . room service be top of the line . we request our room be clean around 10am each morning and they accommodate u . . close to everything . stay and enjoy .,1,77
this be the noisiest hotel ice stay in . it ' s 11pm and i can hear the people next door on speaker phone . i ' ve get my ac crank up and tv to down out the noise . i ' ve also heard people yell down the hall . i have call the front . didn ' t help . i ' ll be complain to corporate in the be . absolutely absurd .,0,77
this resort be locate in the heart of a great area . easy access to restaurant and shopping . upon arrive for check in the entry to the resort be very cozy and well decorate . the registration process be fast and the staff friendly . the room be a little older but clean . hence the 3 star rating . we spend a lot of time in the pool area which be overall maintained okay .,1,77
ordered ticket in advance and walk up to the counter to pick them up and the representative be not polite . she do not and could not answer any question . she want to hand me my ticket and she be very inpatient with me and give me a brochure that i could look at for any additional information . it be not worth the saving to go through them and be treat with such rudeness .,0,77
"this be a very nice look place , but they need to work on fix some of the room item . we stay two night in a suite and the room be clean . the problem that i do not like be that the phone do not work and the shower switch between rain and wand and the switch do not work . i would stay here again if i can find a good rate .",1,76
"so waldorf property have a reputation of outstanding service and nice room . i have to say that i be disappoint with this orlando property in particular . we get a governor room ( pretty big ) but nothing incredible , decor be way too simple and in room dining food be really bad , specially breakfast . poor customer service overall . do not recommend , i would say four season be way better .",0,76
"this be a good place to stay if you be on a budget and have a large family sleep up to 6. the room be not a clean a they should be but the sheet and towel be clean . the fridge be a bonus and okay breakfast be serve . nice pool area , no safe in the room . if you could do without all the highend bullshit this place be for you .",0,76

"this be a good hotel with spacious suite ( 1 queen bed and pullout couch for my children. ) the breakfast buffet be very nice , and i would say it be the best feature of the hotel . $ 15 for adult , and kid eat free all three morning of our stay . we walk to bj ' s pizza restaurant one night . there be also a liquor store around the corner .",1,76
"i have to agree with everything that april p. say in her review . it ' s very mislead . the lobby be all nice and elegant and once you get off the elevator it ' s like a run down motel . it definitely doesn ' t deserve 4 star , i ' d say 3. the only good thing about the hotel be that it ' s down the street from downtown disney .",0,76
"while watch the news at breakfast , the guy come by and shut the tv off right in front of me , when i say excuse me i be watch that he just walk off , when i turn it back on he tell me that i could not do that because breakfast be over and the tv need shut down , and the bed be tiny , hotel a a whole be get wore down",0,76
"the location , near the airport , and the cost make this an acceptable place to stay . the decor be highly dated , but the room and common area appear to be pretty clean . there be a computer in the room , but we could never get it to work . if you a look for a place for a one night stay , then this be not a bad place to stay .",0,76
i would rate this 2 star except for it close location to downtown disney which make walk there much more convenient . this hotel be nothing special compare to some of the other disney hotel . the bed aren ' t very comfortable and the pool be nice but not great . i would recommend check out some of the other disney hotel that have really awesome pool and be more fun to stay at .,0,76
"i have stay at this hotel two time already and both time there have never really be a problem . i stay in a suite with three other people and there be plenty of room . the only downside be that the bathroom door do not lock , the bathtub drain very slowly . other than that , it be a very good stay . very close to universal orlando with a complementary shuttle service .",1,76

"pretty good and standard hotel nothing special just an okey place . the staff in grocery store want tip for sell you stuff big minus there . however they have nice bartender ! the managing of this hotel be a little slow , when something breaka they temporarily fix it just so it barely work . i would probably come back though it a pretty cheap place and you get what you pay for !",0,75
"nicer than your average best western . great location . the pool area and spa be well do and they have a decent fitness center . however , the room be date and very basic for this standard of hotel . i agree with a previous poster that one trash can in the entire room be irksome and the bathroom be clean , but small . overall it be worth the deal on priceline .",0,75

"there simply isn ' t another hotel that can match the view of the castle , space mountain , and the monorail cruise into the contemporary . this may not end up be your favorite resort , but if you be a disney fan you owe it to yourself to stay in a theme park view villa at least once . stay so close be something no other hotel in wdw can match .",1,74

"the room be nice but very small . the hallway also echo very loudly so it sound like people be scream right outside your door at 7am . also the parking be horrible . we have to park a mile away from our room . why be there not enough space to accommodate the hotel ? would not stay here again , there be better place in the area for the price .",0,73

"this place be disgust . clammy , moist air pump through the vent . the conference bathroom be appal - and it be first thing in the morning so they ' ve be that way for a while . 9 of 10 stall stop up with tissue and waste on the floor . parking be terrible too . so many other choice in orlando - pick literally anywhere else .",0,70
"do yourself a huge favor by stay somewhere else that have coffee service in your room , soap and shampoo for when you shower . and , someone that actually be at front desk and answer the phone . room look like they be leave over from 70 ' s and they need to be upgrade . next time i be here on business will definitely go somewhere else .",0,70
it be the most fall apart hotel that i ever saw and they should be close for good that what i think and the safe be break . the tolet get stuff up plus this hotel do not have a plunger by it side . if anyone want to stay at this hotel don ' t. this hotel doesn ' t have any wifi connection only in the lobby .,0,70

"a very clean hotel for reasonable price if you book through `` hotwire '' . this hotel have a very big swimming pool , so if you want to relax at the hotel you can still do so . there ' s a mcdonald and red lobster within 5 minute walk . within hotel they have a buffet , sushi bar , restaurant , bar and a mini- mark .",1,70
zero star ! ! ! ! unbelievably bad service from start to finish ! twenty call and the run around just to book a bday party . forty minute to get cake and candle ; they come separately . it take forever to get refill on drink . every single item be a five to ten minute wait . seriously awful service ; not worth the money at all !,0,70
i will turn blue in the face talk about the cabana inn beach resort . great place . music play everywhere you go . bowl a gym a gift shop ! we have to extend our stay when our teenage daughter put a sad face when we say one more day . keep up the good work . and god willing see you in august 2015 ! ! ! !,1,70

room be suppose to be redone but do not look it . 13 inch tube color tv and bed be hard a a rock . the a/ c be on and freeze and no be to adjust it . i like to be here but i ask for top floor get bottom suite out of order supposedly . good for over night but not a long week stay .,0,69
this place be clean and the staff be really friendly and helpful . . . but i be on the 11th floor and this place be loud ! omg ! i be in the middle of a long hallway and the elevator still wake me up every morning i be there . great potential . . . but they need to do something about noise in the room .,0,69

"customer service be awful . take them almost two hour to find my reservation and the staff be unwilling to get a supervisor when there be an issue because `` they be unavailable '' . the hotel be beautiful , but not worth the hassle . the fact they be unwilling to give me any sort of compensation or discount for an awful experience also blow my mind .",0,69
"old , very old , and outdated . if you be look for a cheap , not well maintain property this be it ! there be plenty of other motel in the area with similar pricing that be way better . . . . do yourself a favor and search them out before you book here . there be no way this should be list a 3 star .",0,69

this hotel be clean and safe ! i be vary pleased with my stay . the room be big and comfy . also vary quiet for sleep . i do wish they have a hot tub and complimentary breakfast . . that would have make my stay perfect . the best part be that the front desk lady do not charge u $ 10 a day for parking !,1,69
"good property . in very good condition . only issue be the water smell funny and the wall be thin . oh , and the in room ac unit be loud . back to positive comment , the staff be top notch . especially at the front desk . i appreciate genuine personality . i dislike when corporation de- humanize every role . kudos to the management team here",1,69
good place to stay . it ' s not to far from the park . . . very central . have bar and pool area . free breakfast before 10am and free shuttle to and from the park . this time we have to wait a little long for the shuttle and the ac wasn ' t work but thankfully it wasn ' t to far : ),1,68
i have be stay at comfort suite downtown for 22 day since my dad have major surgery at florida hospital . location be a significant plus because i can walk to the hospital . second in importance be the 25 % discount because my dad be a patient . third be the complimentary breakfast which be not only good but serve early and by an a+ staff .,1,68
"b- e- a- utiful new hotel . i haven ' t stay in the guest room but i have be to the bar and meet area . the self park situation be a bit confuse at first but once you figure it out , it ' s alright . must try out the pool if you get a chance to stay at the hotel . look fabulous !",1,68
"be ready to find your car in the morning with a broken window due to no camera neither security at the hotel parking lot ! that ' s what happen with u and 2 other guest ' s car with their window break at the same night ! hotel doesn ' t take any responsibility in it , which be very unfair . plus terrible wifi service !",0,68
double tree might a well be call dollar tree . the only reason it ' s get 2 star be because of it proximity to the park . the wall be not soundproof at all which can be very annoy . it ' s quite outdated and could definitely use a remodel . go to cabana bay if you ' re look for a place to stay .,0,68
"be careful of the gift store . i write my christmas card during some down time at a conference . a forever stamp be currently 46 cent . the shop want to charge an additional 50 cent per stamp . this gift shop be a major rip off and exploit hotel guest . no , i didnt buy stamp n will send em off when i return home",0,68

my biggest beef be a lack of tub in the bathroom and carpeting in the guest room . the hard floor be of particular concern a it not comfy for bare foot and it loud - i could hear the room next to me and above me - they need the sound deaden carpet would provide . i would not recommend a stay at the parc soleil .,0,68
it ' s a nice hotel . very close to disney world the room be very roomy & amp ; nice . the pool be gorgeous . but the room service be soo expensive & amp ; the food be not worth it . . . then the parking be horrible why do you have so many room if you don ' t have enough parking spot .,0,68
this place look better through picture then it do in person . i saw a few bug and the shower be dirty i be a little frighted to to get in there . the only thing i like about this hotel be that they have shutter and everything be with in minute away . they have a pool and kiddy play lot a well a free wifi .,0,68
"do not stay here . the carpet in the hallway be stain and reek of smoke and mildew . the bathroom be downright nasty , include gross mildew shower . the room itself smell downright funky and there be a hairy booger cake on my pillow . vomit . i repeat : do not stay here . if you be desperate , sleep in your car ! !",0,68
the three bedroom suite be very spacious . consider the groupon deal for this resort you receive a good value . a lot of water activity be offer on their lake . if you plan on have party please request a first floor so you do not disturb other guest surround you . three noise complaint and you will get kick out . parking be limit .,1,67
"hotel be nice , pool & amp ; hot tub be great . transportation service be wonderful to/ from the park ! the entire staff be extremely helpful & amp ; friendly . room could use to be update a bit . but , if you can get a great price - do it ! breakfast buffet be average , but quick & amp ; decent !",1,67

my family and i travel to orlando several time a year . we have stay at several of the very nice hotel and a few of the not so nice . this happen to be a gem in the rough . the galleria palm have some of the cleanest room of any of the hotel in the area . the staff be extremely friendly and accommodate .,1,67
horrible experience . i ' m a hilton honor member and have reserve 2 night non- smoking but end up in a smoking room . they claim they couldn ' t do anything about it later due to full availability . really ? then why confirm me when both my reward preference be previously establish + i have personally request the non- smoking state when reserving .,0,67
"the room smell like chemical that be mean to cover up bad odor but do a bad job at it . the bed be really squeaky and the sheet a hard a paper . the breakfast seem like burger king breakfast ; not my ideal choice , but it ' s better than nothing . i win ' t lie , it wasn ' t terrible .",1,67
ive star here a few time for business . it ' s your standard convention hotel . loud and thousand of teenager for cheer or future noisemaker of america . press all the button on a 24 floor elevator be only fun the first time kid . the room be well appoint while 80 ' s size with 8 ' ceiling even in the executive suite .,0,67
we love this place . we be owner here and we be so happy to be able to come here every year . we haven ' t trade because we like it here so much . this make our 5th visit and it be great a usual . can ' t wait to come back next year . great location a a base to explore orlando .,1,67
my boyfriend and i stay here for a quick one day trip to universal for my birthday and it be perfect for a quick stay . the price be a little much but i also book during spring break : / the breakfast at hampton inn hotel be easily one of the best out there and this place be the same ! would definitely book again !,1,67
check- in and checkout process be fast . the room be clean and carpet not run down . the shower area have mold and the wash table area be too small . love the pillow . different density but the bed be not very comfortable . like the bed a bit firm . the airco be very quiet and the location be away from heavy traffic .,1,67
"great check in , great bed , very clean , well maintain , not sure if it rate a a 4 star , but it ' s a good solid location . a bit of a pain to get to but that ' s the fault of the gps . . . pay wifi ? seem especially petty for a 4 star location . . .",1,66
"i wish they would clean up the property . i live down the street and when you drive by it look like a dump ! weed and trash all over . i ' ll never set foot in hj because of this . if what you can see be so poorly maintain , think about what you can ' t see , like the kitchen !",0,66
"great airport hotel . good location if you have an early/ late flight from mco , but not much else in the area . we have stay for a night to accommodate flight , but would not choose this location for a full trip . shuttle service be very convenient , and even take u to & amp ; from a nearby restaurant for dinner .",1,66
"the staff be friendly and the price be reasonable for a hotel very close to the park and downtown disney . but if you don ' t get it with a groupon , you pay too much . the room be terrible , dirty and smelly . bed be comfortable but hard to relax on because the sheet be worn and stain . not pleasant .",0,66
it be an ok experience . i stay there for four day and one of the pool be out of service . the room be small but it be in a great location and close to i- 4 and disney . if your look for a top of the line hotel definitely not the place but for a cheap quick place to stay it work .,0,66
absolutely atrocious ! ! ! ! be warn . the place outside be ok when we look for our room no elevator be in sight . we finally get to the room and there be no ac the rug have stain all over just disgust . when we go five minute later to check out they refuse to return our money . what a dump !,0,66
only reason i didnt give it a perfect score be because i be still look for perfection . beautiful room and very attentive service . lot of parking and when you come downstairs your can just enter the mall . restaurant and shopping and you dont have to get into a car just an elevator . tie for best hotel stay i ever have .,1,65
"how can this sheet place review with 3 star . be all your nose not functional . i change the room once . however , the poison shampoo use kill me even i keep the door open whole night . never punish your health with this place . i ' d rather sleep on the ground anywhere in orlando than in this sheet hole .",0,65

"rough around the edge , generally unclean room , and poor/ unresponsive/ uncaring front desk staff . but it ' s around $ 75/ night , so it doesn ' t get much cheaper . due to the general dirtiness of the room , i wouldn ' t stay here again . consider other hotel in the area - - there be a ton !",0,65
"this be a hotel for a time- share property . . . great layout , nice staff , and it ' s close to everything . i wish they have orange juice at the front desk in the morning , but it ' s cool . the bed be king- size and they have a few suanas and a pool on the property also .",1,65

"awesome hotel to be for fun , relaxation , and sit to explore by walk around it compound . i appreciate them let u use their convention hall for a leadership weekend event and allow u to enjoy the room ay a great deal . it ' s a testament to how they look out for anyone host an event at the gaylord palm .",1,65
"great location , friendly staff , large suite , and good pool . i have stay here five time and always have enjoy a pleasant experience . the only negative i can think of be that some of the furnishing and linen be show their age . beyond that minor quibble , i highly recommend this resort for anyone visit orlando with a family .",1,65
"mickey ' s philharmagic be a pretty cool experience . buzz lightyear ' s attraction be awesome too . the disney character at the parade be so beautiful/ handsome . bring umbrella , flip flop , extra clothes , and raincoat ! ! ! it keep rain the first day i go . by the way , the food at their restaurant be lame .",1,65
"when we arrive , our room have 1 small bottle of shampoo and conditioner about 5ml only , we need to ask more from the housekeeping . the next day our room be not clean and we need to ask the housekeeping to get the trash out . because the hotel be just newly build , the garmin gps can not locate the hotel .",1,65
5 star just for the amazing view my boyfriend and i have from our room . customer service be the usual from a hotel . nothing extraordinary happen but all in all happy with our stay . also seem like they recently have construction . only thing i wasn ' t happy with be park and their location seem to be a bit hidden .,1,65
"not great . this be a 3 . 5- star hotel and i ' ve be to better 2 and 3- star hotel . first of all , they charge you 10 more dollar if you book it on priceline . the tap water be low on pressure , sheet on bed look cheap , no easy access to good restaurant or grocery store .",0,65
"the parking be far . . . . make a note of where you park . we leave after the electrical parade at night & amp ; have to wait a long time for the tram due to the full capacity of the park . many ride that be in california , but the difference be apparent . overall we have a good time .",1,65
"never again . cold shower , phone didn ' t work to call the front desk . the service be certainly friendly , i be just disappoint in the shower and lack of ability to follow up without have to walk over to the front desk . there be no reason this motel should call itself a resort- - it ' s a stretch !",0,65
this place be absolutely gorgeous but beware of the timeshare crook . they be a bunch of liar . they state that the presentation be 90 minute . it be 4 . 5 hour . they also attempt to change and increase the amount of my disney ticket . you will waste a good half of your day fool with these liar and thief .,0,65
"this would have be 4 star until last night , when i be welcome back by the huge roach . when i call the front desk to complain the receptionist be nice enough to explain they be all over the property . she do advise that they spray 3 time a week , so nothing would be do until saturday . . . perfect !",0,65
"pretty good place . smaller compare to other dvc location . very confuse check in a they make me check in at contemporary resort . cons- no food at this resort . have to walk to resort next door for food . also , the elevator take forever ! ! ! ! pros- close to magic kingdom , great view , and great pool .",0,65
"get it a a great deal on priceline and stay there on a late flight in with a good morning breakfast , comfortable , big room , small bathroom space without any place to hang clothes or towel . it be near some restaurant but no fast food if you don ' t have a car . overall , easy in and easy out .",1,65
not an amazing hotel or anything but the water taxi be really convenient . typically very expensive all around a be a typical tourist gear hotel . i ' d stay again but for the same price or le you can stay at the gaylord palm or something . i ' d recommend it overall though if someone want to stay on site .,1,64
"grand bohemian be a great place to stay . it be a luxury hotel in a nice location in orlando . it be centrally locate , walk distance from many bar and restaurant and about 15- 20 minute away from the amusement park . the room be very clean and there be a gorgeous lobby . great service and overall a great stay .",1,64

"we can ' t complain , our dinner be free and delicious . my boyfriend do not enjoy the calm sauce a much a he think he would , but we share a fillet and gator bite appetizer that make up for it ; overall filling and tasty experience . selection of hot tea be great , and bread basket be never empty .",0,64
"spacious room , very nice . best thing about this hotel be the club lounge , and the staff work at the lounge . they always have a smile on their face , can keep a conversation , and always go the extra mile . food at the lounge be fantastic , much better than go any where at the hotel to eat .",1,64
"well only one room read ( three hour after the check- in time , the bar can ' t make basic cocktail , and the reservation be all jack up , otherwise it ' s be a great day at animal kingdom ! i ' ll update this post before we leave , but thus far this hotel be strike out with me .",0,64

i stay here with my family last summer and it be great . great service and great food . the water taxi make life much easier when visit the theme park or when drinking at citiwalk . the only down fall be they dont tell you until you get there that the parking isnt free . i highly recommend this resort to anyone .,1,64
"frequent marriott stayer , this one be awful , just awful . the elite check- in employee have an attitude , don ' t expect a lot from a marriott but feel sorry for the family that be plan their big vacation at disney . just go to show you one `` bad egg '' can ruin the reputation for the entire business .",0,64
"no update from when i stay over fifteen+ year ago ! ? i ride the glass `` charlie and the chocolate factory '' elevator all the way to the top all night long act a the elevator operator . who stay in the bathroom/ room long enough to use the tv ? luxurious , but no upgrade in over fifteen year ! ! ?",0,64
decent place but the hampton inn be handicap by have one of the dumbest customer service group i have encounter . do you really have to tell the book person 6 time the name of the city you want to book your hotel . they either need to fire the lot or invest some significant training resource in their customer service book department,1,63
"over price and it just do not deliver . boring , ice cold pool , bore property . expensive and crowd . many better choice in the wdw resort . someone be asleep at the wheel when they design this place . look promising and cute a all get out in the online literature , , it isn ' t. total bust .",0,63
decent hotel for long term stay . need update but comfortable accommodation for a large family . the regular housekeeper on the 3rd floor be a treasure and be great . pool area be nice ! not a five star hotel but good for what you get . kid like breakfast and i like the soda machine for free in the be !,0,63

the rating be pretty accurate . the flooring in the hotel be very dirty and need replacing . the facility require some updating . the maid don ' t speak english so communicate the room need be difficult . the room itself be adequate but i wish it have a microwave . the hotel be in excellent location and be family friendly .,0,63
i4 road noise be very loud . these wall be paper thin . if u be not easy sleeper u will be up all night . not a 3 star place . 1 star for me . old room and bathroom be small not very clean . it could use clorox or tilex to clean it . will never stay here again .,0,63

"we stay here for our monthly universal trip this august 14- 16 weekend . it be wonderful . the staff be very friendly and we have everything to our fingertip . the restaurant inside mama della ' s ristorante have very good tasting wine and great recipe . definitely will be come back again , be very satasfied with their service .",1,62
"you pay for what you get . for $ 111 . 00 per night ( aaa rate ) you get wonderful front desk staff . you get a semi comfortable king room . you get a door that be difficult locking . small pool , even smaller gym . breakfast just your typical freebie . not the right hotel for u .",1,62
