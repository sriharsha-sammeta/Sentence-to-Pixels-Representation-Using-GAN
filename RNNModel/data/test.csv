"first , let me say the staff be very nice and professional , and the property itself be a plus - - lot of amenity . pool , bar , restaurant , spa - - all very nice . unfortunately , i be book for a conference on wed- friday . there be an early morning `` pre '' workshop available on wednesday morning ( at additional cost on top of the conference fee ) , so i fly in tuesday evening . arrive late ( after 2a ) , i attempt to check in but be tell by the night staff that there be `` a problem '' with my room and they would have to put me in a different room . say there would be a bed to sleep on and a restroom , but no shower , however , i could switch room 1st thing in the morning to shower and prep for the pre- conference session . alternatively , they could send me to a sister hotel 15 minute away for the night . give i need to be awake 5 hour later and at my conference , i opt for the room . i be take to what they later call the `` parlor '' and find that it be really more of a meeting/ party room , not a guest room . the couch have be make into bed ( like a hide- a- bed ) and the restroom be somewhat commercial . after 9 hour of travel i wasn ' t sleep on a hide- a- bed for $ $ $ per night , so i go back to the front desk . they say the only option be for me to go to the other hotel . it be 3a by this time ( and i need to be in my morning session by 8 : 30a ) . they give me a voucher to take a ride over to the wyndham , and say that 1st thing in the morning i could come back and a room would be ready for me so that i could iron , shower and dress . i go to the wyndham ( a couple step down from the doubletree , and a $ 50 reduction in cost accord to the receipt i obtain ) , and first thing in the morning go back to the doubletree to prep for my meeting . the desk staff say no room be available and that because it be early and people be just check out , there wasn ' t anything ready for me . they say i could check my bag and go to my pre- conference session ( have not shower in over 24 hour nor shave , and dress in a tshirt and jean ) . i explain i need to clean up , iron , etc . and the worker say i should have do that at the wyndham . i remind them that the night crew say i could come back in the morning and prep . in any case , i have to wait for them to get housekeep to prep a room for me and a a result , by the time i be able to get into my room and prep , it be nearly 10 : 30 and i ' d miss nearly all of the 8 : 30- 11 : 30 session ( which , again , be both an additional cost and the reason i ' d come the night before in the first place ) . to their credit , they give me a breakfast voucher while i await the housekeeper ' s prep of my room . late that day , after i get out of my afternoon meeting , i arrive to find a plate of cheese and fruit from the manager apologize for the mix- up . fair enough , but we ' re out $ 300 for a workshop i couldn ' t attend , and i ' m out personally $ $ for travel the day prior , tip for the shuttle and porter at the wyndham , etc . the following day , i stop between session at avalon for lunch but wait 20 minute w/ o the server ever come to my table ( i do ask a busser to help but she never come ) . have to grab an energy bar for lunch to return to my meeting . later , i return to find my room hasn ' t be clean . the room now stink from the ( blue ) cheese plate ( no refrigerator ) , and it look a it do at 7a . that morning . in the hallway , the housekeeper tell me she didn ' t clean it because they have me list a check out that day ( thursday ) , when my reservation and confirmation be for friday check out and i ' d reconfirm it when i check in . i have to go to the lobby to work it out , and then wait an hour to return to the room so that she can clean it . i have ask for the manager to contact me on wednesday morning when the check- in snafu occur , but aside from the cheese plate - - nobody call . a i check out on friday , i advise the front desk that i be disappoint . the staff call a supervisor over and ask about my experience , and i explain it . i also note my displeasure at be charge my full rate for tuesday night even though they send me to another hotel at 3a and that hotel be $ 50 per night than the doubletree . she end up take off the tuesday night charge entirely , which be nice , but i don ' t think she understand that ultimately that 1 ) just save my employer from the expense and 2 ) do nothing for me a the traveler that be inconvenience . the saving from that hotel night don ' t make up for the $ 300 workshop that be miss , nor the cost incur by me to arrive a day early . . . all of which be for naught . this wasn ' t a last minute booking . . . it be book 3 month prior . that they be overbooked and `` walk '' a 3 month old booking to a lower grade hotel doesn ' t say a lot about how they handle their guest - - especially the one arrive for hosted conference",0,1120
"cape fear1 star for the beach club ? seem kind of harsh , doesn ' t it ? must have be infest with bed bug , right ? well no , it wasn ' t. and if the room a $ 150 a night , i ' d be sing it praise . but i actually schlepped out close to $ 500 a night and for that much money , i expect a lot . the beach club do not deliver . some of what you ' ll read in this review may seem petty . but when you ' re the one foot the bill , perspectives change . point one : noise and lame service . if you have child , the beach club may be a wonderful place for you and your family . but if you be 40- somethings without kid , heed my warning and do not stay here . let me say up front that i volunteer with kid and i adore them . and i know that disney be a place for kid and grownup alike . but the beach club be market a a luxury resort . a such , i expect more than paper thin wall and ( un- sound- proofed ) door to adjoin suite that let me hear , in intimate detail , every kid ' s temper tantrum . tantrum at 7 : 00 be . tantrum at 8 : 00 pm . tantrum at 1 : 00 be . it get so bad that we ask to have our room switch , which disney do . we pack up everything and trudge down the hall 50 foot with our bag in tow ( the hotel do offer to send a bellhop , but i couldn ' t bring myself to tip someone for my have to move ) . in our new room same thing , just different hour of tantrum . wail kid . at least these didn ' t wail past 10 : 00 pm . at one point , i call the front desk to say how disappointed i be . i tell the woman on the other end that `` i know that kid will be kid but that the wall be thin. `` i say that `` i couldn ' t be the first person to notice this '' and , accord to her , i be . but then i look on trip advisor and load of people have the same complaint . apparently , neither she nor anyone else at the beach club keep themselves up to date with what their customer be actually say about their alleged luxury resort . i ask her if i could speak to the manager and she say that i could stop down or that he or she would call me back . well , i be too tire to talk to the manager and the manager must have be too tired to call me back , because he or she never do . if anyone at the beach club show my wife and me just the least bit of empathy our entire disposition could have be different . an apology , a couple of complementary bottle of water , anything . but we get nothing . it ' s a if disney train their employee not to apologize because do so will mean that the customer need to be make whole in some way . but i wasn ' t look to sue disney . i wasn ' t even look for a free night ' s stay . i simply want some empathy which i never get . point two : extreme makeover need . this place need an upgrade in the worst way . let me repeat : it ' s close to $ 500 a night to stay here . when we first check in and head towards our room , my wife and i have a sinking feeling . we saw worn carpeting and mark on the wall . the hallway be freeze due to antiquated control . in our room , we notice chip on the furniture and the mark of a thousand stroller on the base of the dresser . a corner of the wallpaper in the entrance area of our room hang down - a daily reminder of the lack of upkeep . the thermostat be a date a the carousel of progress . it be simply a knob - left for cold and right for hot - no temperature set . i finally have to rely on align the knob with one of the letter on the device to know what sorta work . it felt like our room be either freeze or warm and musty . in our first room , the shower diverter wasn ' t work - half of the water would come out the tub when shower . they fix it after two call . in our second room , the shower diverter work but so much so that the pressure actually kind of hurt . i know , it sound like i ' m whining . but , if you use the same shower , you ' d probably say the same thing . the bed itself be comfortable enough but the sheet and blanket never quite come up far enough ( believe me , we try pull them up ) and the bedding lack the warmth we need in our room ( we be there in november ) . point three : weird housekeeping . in our second room , we leave in the be for the park and be sure to leave the `` do not disturb sign '' off to let housekeep know that we weren ' t there . when we come back around 2 : 00 pm , the towel be replace but the bed be strip bare - a if the maid be catch up in the rapture . we call housekeeping and the woman say she ' d take care of it . when we come back at night , the sheet be on the bed but the extra blanket that we get from the closet ( to prevent our freeze ) lay on top of the desk and all five pillow be on the ( somewhat suspect ) couch . in all of my day of travel , i ' ve occasionally have my room miss by the maid . but i ' ve never have my room half- do by one . and twice in one day set a new kind of record . bizarre .",0,1115
"nickel and dim . . . scammed . . . then irritate . other than those staff integrity issue , it be alright . stay at this hotel last weekend and it be just okay . some good , some bad . from the get- go , i have a bad experience . when go to check in the front desk person tell me that if i want two bed instead of one king that there be go to be a $ 30 charge . i find that to be just absurd . why would you charge somebody $ 30 to have two bed instead of one bed , i ' ve never hear any place do that before . so it ' s not about $ 30 , but more of the question a to why . i don ' t care to be nickel and dim for $ 30. it put a bad taste in my mouth . i ' m an entrepreneur , ceo and my company have about 50 employee . if my accounting can book a nice hotel for le on priceline i ' m go to go ahead and have them do that . it really bother me when i get treat like a second- class citizen by the front desk staff because i book on priceline . anyhow , when i be speak to this gentleman , a female employee come up & amp ; ask if there be a problem . i say i think it be rather ridiculous that i be be charge $ 30 for two bed . i also tell her that i have call a soon a the room be book and request two separate bed and that the person on the phone say that that would not be a problem . this girl that say to me , `` well do you remember who you talk to ? `` me that be just an absurd question to ask a customer . of course nobody ' s go to remember the person that they speak on the phone to pertain to ask for two bed at a hotel room five week ago . why would you ask a customer that when you already know what the answer be go to be . like i ' m go to say , `` oh yeah i speak with mary five week ago that ' s who it was. `` it ' s just absurd to ask somebody that . they wouldn ' t budge on the $ 30 and that leave a bad taste in my mouth . my director of sale be with me and rather perturb at them a well and of the notion that he and i would be share a king bed . she also say to me , `` well maybe you should take that up with priceline. `` again why in the world would you say something like that and customer . i tell her to just process the room a i no longer want to discuss it . we check into the room in the room be nice . it have a refrigerator and a microwave in it a well . the bed be very comfortable too . we have a room that overlook the pool and the surround area which be quite nice . the room be actually quite nice a well . one bad be that the water level in the shower fluctuate , a well a , the pull up knob for the shower be break and doesn ' t fully engage . be anybody from the hotel care it room 1218. we both go to the bar the first night a it be late and we fly from the west coast and we ' re hungry . we sit at the bar for over five minute wait for service a he apparently be eat a meal in the back office room to the left . nonetheless , he be friendly and the food for the most part be good . we drop a hundred buck on the meal and here be where the inconsistency start with this service staff . the billing be correct , and he do not include the gratuity on the bill and i provide my standard 25 % gratuity to the check . later we go out to the bar by the pool and i order a draft beer from the lady bartender . i ask her to start a tab and then about a half hour later i close it out . i sign the check to my room and leave a tip . later when i go back to the room i note that the bartender put an 18 % gratuity on the check and never tell me about this . to me this be a real integrity issue . server in the industry call this double dip the tip . to me it ' s basically very dishonest to present somebody a check that have an 18 % gratuity on it and not tell them about it . it ' s sneaky , a you ' re try to get double tip . sunday afternoon i go back to the lobby bar to set up my laptop and meet with a client , have some food , and watch a little bit of nfl football . the service be good but we be really basically the only people in there . the thing i point out here be that the bartender bring my check and say , `` thank you very much gentleman for come in , just to let you know there be an 18 % gratuity already add to your bill . thanks guys. `` now obviously this guy have integrity a he point out that his tip be include and point to where we could add more if we want ; which i do . my point on all of this be one bartender put no gratuity on the check , one bartender put a gratuity on there and surreptitiously do not tell you about it , another put it on there and tell you about it . this be very inconsistent and to me create the ability for a staff to be very sneaky and dishonest . i think all of it a little bit disconcert . this staff from the bartender to the front desk have not really impressed u so far so instead of have our business party of 10 at the hotel here , we go to the rosen creek resort steakhouse instead and spend the money there .",1,1114
"the happiest place on earth ? ( maybe for it shareholder ) ! s. o. s. i be currently stick in this hell hole and have to be here for close to a week ! i have have enough after 2 day . i simply can not believe that people fall all over themselves to plan ahead , cram in and overpay to visit this vastly overhyped attraction . love long line , food price double what they should be with no other reasonable option , drink cup that control your conduct , oppressive heat , and child on melt down ? well this be the place for you . i be currently here with my four year old . i be tell that late august be a good time to go because fl child be in school . we be stay at carribean beach resort . where to start ? 1. every morning that we be not eat at a park , we eat at the royal port something or other . there be about 10 breakfast option , typical fare . most of it taste like heat and eat from frozen and cost $ 9- $ 10. if you act fast and see someone leave , you may be fortunate enough to get a seat . seating be an issue all morning , 7 : 30 , 9 : 30- - doesn ' t matter . not thrill with sub par breakfast at double price while have to worry about get a seat . who would be ? 2. the $ 16 . 50 drink cup . for that price you can buy a cup that you can refill from the royal port soda fountain . there be actually a chip in the bottom that allow the cup to be use , and i be tell that it expire the second you check out . fair enough . it also lock out your cup for a few minute after you fill it . so don ' t take a quick swig or some sample , a you ' ll be stand there push the fountain button like an idiot , wonder why you can not master a simple device . the cup be simply `` magical '' like much of my experience . 3. the $ 35- $ 50 `` character meal '' - you ' d think that for the price of park admission ( all seem to be approx $ 100 and only slightly le for child ) , you would have opportunity to get your child to see and greet the character . doesn ' t seem to happen unless you go to one of these meal . the food at these be usually buffet style and pretty good ( like $ 17- $ 25 good ) . crowd always , and i be tell that if you don ' t make a reservation month ahead of time , plan to wait 30- 60 mins- yes , to see some flunkie in a mickey , donald , etc . , mask . the mask be pretty cool , i must say . 4. the line be absurd . the line for the toy story ride in hollywood be out the door - - but we have make a fast pas reservation ( better eat quick/ eat slow/ hope we get seat soon , a we have to make the fast pas time window ! ) . no , this be the fast pas line . wait 20- 25 min . the general line be at 125 min ! . have great fun for 4 or so min on the ride . i be tell by an employee- friend that work here that the typical line at the water park be 30 min ( for a water slide ) ! 5. buses- the bus be a great idea and do run pretty efficiently . but after a long morning at the park , the last thing i want be to be cram into a tiny bus seat next to some fat smelly sweaty guy ( and i be sure folk feel the same about me ) . have fun yet ? ? 6. children- grant , i be here for the kid and be just hop to have an ok time . but with all of the waiting and other hassle , the kid be constantly pretty unhappy and on near- melt down . who can blame her ? 7. heat- do i mention it be hot ? add a crowd and a long line for a wonderful heat trifecta ! now i certainly can ' t blame disney for heat in august , but it only become more unbearable give the other issue . 8. the line to get in in . the fingerprinting be absurd ! and hold up the whole process . the bag check be long also , but can not blame disney for that ( thanks osama ) . 9. rip off photo package- not enough photographer around to justify the $ 120. think there would be many more . the lack of flexibility and confinement i feel here be best describe a follow . my wife and inlaws have a dinner reservation in magic kingdom for 3 : 30 , so they leave at 2 : 30 to hit the bus . i can ' t stand another overprice cramp restaurant so i send them out without me . i figure i would leave an hour later in the car to meet up for the evening . i drive to magic kingdom and park the car . people be cram onto tram from there . i ask the parking lot attendant how long to walk to the park . he say 10 min and point in the right direction . i walk in that direction and arrive just when a tram that i do not get onto also arrive . it be not clear where the park be from here . i ask an employee and be tell that you have to take a monorail or some other method from there . well , how far of a walk ? he say `` you can ' t walk , it a mile. `` he continue '' it be design that way because you be leave the real world behind and enter the magic world '' he explain . it must be some special kind of magic to make people tolerate this at these price . i only wish there be some of that magic to spare to blink myself home . never again !",0,1114
"stay here last december/ january for four day while in town for the citrus bowl . i can honestly say it be one of the most disappointing experience of my life . it all start out good go downhill very quickly . first of all , i find out that in addition to pay 200 . 00 a night for a 3 star hotel it cost 20 . 00 a day to park . and you have no choice . there be no place on the street to park so you will pay it . but that be fine . i be willing to accept that and move on . it be vacation so i wasn ' t gon na get too hung up over 80 buck . later on i would become much more annoyed with it when for 80 buck i would have to drive around in circle around the entire hotel for half an hour every night wait for a spot to open and usually wind up have to walk a third of a mile back to my room . anyway , to get back on track , i park my car and my room be in what be obviously a very old hotel that have be renovate behind a new tower that have be add later . no biggie . the place be beautifully landscape with tropical plant and have a very relaxing feel to it . at first that be . i get to my room and it be great . very tasteful decor . i be happy . but that be short- lived . near my room be a pool . the cheesy steel drum music blare . and the kid scream , and scream , and scream . all . . . night . . . long . . . and i heard every bit of it because the wall be evidently paper thin . and lucky me , the pool doesn ' t close until freakin ' midnight so i get to roll around in my bed for a couple of hour unable to sleep because of all the damn noise . it be like hell on earth and i be definitely get the feeling that i have make a huge mistake by book there . that feel would be reconfirm throughout my stay . the next morning i get up and the first thing i wan na do be get the hell out of that room so i go to the front desk to see what they can do for me . there be three black girl there . i feel guilty because i can ' t recall their name except for one ( lakeisha i believe ) . they get me into another room , thankfully ( or so i thought ) . these girl be all very sweet and do their best to make me happy . they be about the only bright spot in my stay there . but , a it turn out , the move only help so much . outside the room the walk be all concrete , and the design of the structure be such that the already loud noise from the cart of the cleaning staff roll down the concrete be magnify to nearly train- like proportion . and those cart never stop come . all day long , anytime i be in my room , i hear them . after i have get move i go to the hotel ' s breakfast buffet . a far a the food it be alright . about the same a you would get if you go to a golden corral . only double the price . orlando be a tourist trap i expect to be overcharge for such so i roll with it . but what really chap my as be the bad service . bad service at two hundred buck a night ! ! ! rather than just have thing set up where you could refill your own drink and serve yourself you have to wait on a server to take your order for a drink . which make no sense really from a business perspective . so the first server be some foreign girl name mary lou i believe . mary lou take my order for my drink . then take about 20 minute to finally get it to me . refill be free there but , in this case , mary lou be evidently hell bent on make sure your first drink be your last . i didn ' t see her again for a good 30 minute so i couldn ' t get a refill or pay my bill so i could get the hell out . when she finally come by my table again she try to rush me out like she couldn ' t be bother with refill my drink or ask me if there be anything else she could do for me . all of this in spite of the fact that the place wasn ' t very crowded . and stupid me , i come back the next morning think maybe i would get another server and better service . well , i do get a different server . some young guy with a russian accent . a it turn out , he possess a work ethic equally a substandard a mary lou ' s. the next day i try a place across the street that be staff seemingly by nothing but retire new yorkers . and the service there be nearly a bad . but at least it be half the price . the moral of the story here folk be to steer clear of this place . take my word for it . i ' m not a complainer . i ' m relatively easy to please . out of the hundred of night i have spend in hotel i ' ve only ever complain about one other . positively the worst experience i have ever have at any hotel . which i find very surprising . i ' ve stay at a number of doubletree ' s and never have a bad experience . but they should really just demolish this one and start all over . if you ' re look for a place to stay in orlando do yourself a favor and avoid this one like that plague . go down the street to the hilton orlando . very similarly price but a much better experience . you ' ll be glad you do .",0,1103
"have be tell that this be a newbie resort of just 3 year old , i have to rate it at least 4 star . the ground be amazing , the pool be clean and expansive . the entire resort make you feel spoil but much of the staff need to be on board with make the guest feel respect and welcome . the resort be large . it be over 500 acre , much of it the golf course , but there be many other amenity . i recommend you study their ground map prior to arrival because on arrival you will not be give a tour or even a briefing of what the ground have to offer . take some time , go smell the flower , check out the herb garden ( though they be not in optimum use and the citrus garden be two tree ! ) and meander the walkway . sit on the pier in the waterway , listen to nature ( over look the ritz ' s lack of clean theirs- lot of cigarette butt , trash near the pier , cob and spider web and old and new bird droppings ) experience the blend of real nature and the manmade beautification . marriot seem to do a better job keep up their side of the ground , if it ' s all the same ground keeper they overlook trash , debris and need upkeep in many area around the ritz . while i , and many others , stay here this week have valid complaint , i would not hesitate to return , there be just that much to offer . that say , i have not ever be to a resort that have so many complaint openly talk about between guest , in such a short time frame and with all be fairly well acquaint with marriot and resort , these complaint should not be take lightly , change should be make . my party be , a be others , give mixed , incorrect information about cost , time and availability or access to for much of the amenity . examples- * i be tell there be sauna and private whirlpool . . . i be not tell they come at a charge be $ 50/ day ! and that type of deception be rampant here . * `` our pool all open at 7 be '' ( they open at 8 ) , `` we have free kayak for guest '' ( they be $ 30/ half hour ! ) , * `` we have an amazing eco kayak tour '' ( young kid have no idea what to tell u about ecology of the area and be actually just ' fill in ' ) so do they call to tell u they don ' t have a guide ? no . do not take our money for some lame eco tour that we could have just paddle on our own . shame on them at the `` our eco tour be $ 40 ( concierge ) `` to be charge $ 60. i will attempt to have those charge reverse .

( the price on resort be outrageous- with just a few dollar in reduction they might do a bigger volume . i hear so many people say they would not eat on site , ' wait ' til we go to _ _ _ _ , or even debate share one sandwich ( not a bad idea for most of u but still $ 8 . 50 or more for a half sandwich ) lower food charge , especially out in the pool area , would certainly benefit those hungry staff worker , that have little to do if the blue flag be not be raise on the back of the chair . * be disrespect by staff- another guest tell me she be reprimand for order her sandwich from bodega and then go to starbuck to order her coffee . yes , reprimand . i know it ' s true because i be tell these same word `` it only take 60 second for u to make your sandwich '' she be tell `` next time ' order your coffee first ! rudely . i be overlook for 5 minute at the lobby bar , two other men walk ni and sit down on either side of the bar be serve first , and then when the bartender do approach me , she ask me my room number aloud , she do not ask the other two men . . . i tell her i would not give out my room number aloud ! at the lazy river pool , younger staff member can be rude near closing time . there be way to say , we be close soon , with make it sound like `` get out now '' . over all the staff need to be teach some manner to approach each and every guest to make them feel good to be at the resort . in addition to all that , i do try to make arrangement for local attraction , something nature fill with one of the concierge , i make my own reservation for an eco kayak tour and request more outdoors activity . i be send indoor skydiving a a suggestion and other - `` can do everywhere '' activity . by pas the concierge that don ' t listen and research yourself . i recommend close by manatee viewing and interaction walk in tarpon spring . our grouper at the kitchen on site be really good , ham hock- too salty , so on the side for that . ( best waitstaff be at the kitchen- hand down ) my chicken be perfect , the sauce , mixed on that . the restaurant on site be all okay , some not so okay- i do not try harrys though . if you plan to eat on site often , be prepare to open you wallet wider than normal .",1,1094
"so , 11 friend & amp ; i decide to stay at this hotel from june 2nd- june 6th . at the time of check in , we request if 2 of the 4 room could possibly be join room . we be advise , that it ' s possible but we would be several floor away from the rest of our party & amp ; near the elevator . we agree , to only find out we be certainly several floor away from the rest of our party & amp ; near the elevator but join room , we do not have . set on have a great time we decide to just leave it be . during our stay i decline to have housekeep enter my room , i approach the housekeeper on our floor daily to swap our dirty towel for fresh towel along with a generous tip . on sunday afternoon my friend & amp ; i go out to lunch & amp ; arrive back to find out i have no access to my room . for some reason our key be deactivate , i go down the front desk & amp ; lucky me it be check in time for several guest . i stand in the long line & amp ; decide to call the front desk & amp ; hop since this be an error make by the hotel i would be ask to step up to the front desk to have my key quickly reactivate . yeah , that do not happen , i be tell . . . `` yes , you need to stand in line ! `` once i finally reach the front desk , i advise to her what happen & amp ; ask why be my key deactivate when she state `` the only reason we would deactivate your key be if you be check out or you owe u money. `` which be neither in my case so she reactivate my key , not at any time during our interaction do she apologize or express any type of sympathy or regret . ( i personally find it interesting , so if you owe them money their policy be to lock you out of your room & amp ; hold your personal item ransom ) . anyways , again not want to ruin the rest of my vacation i decide to simply to go up to my room & amp ; ignore their rudeness & amp ; unprofessionalism . early monday morning , we find out our flight be delay & amp ; one of my the guest in my room be up all night with a fever & amp ; suffering of flu symptom , i contact the front desk & amp ; request a late check in , i be give an additional hour . later that morning we be advise that our flight be push back farther , i contact the front desk again & amp ; ask if we could get a later check out due to the circumstance . i be advise that our entire floor be sell out to a group & amp ; that our original late check out be be deny , due to it be totally impossible . my friend ( the sick one ) grab the phone & amp ; offer to pay for a late check out . . . magically for 50 buck we could have late check out until 3 : 00pm . shady if you ask me ! but anyways a we be leave our room , i realize we leave our delicious dessert on the desk/ table , i attempt to reenter the room to see that our key be deactivate again . not want to get piss off , we all say just forget about it . a we get in the elevator the housekeeper ask if we be check out , we tell her yes & amp ; tell her we leave untouched dessert in the room she can have . once we finally board our plane , i realize i leave my samsung galaxy tablet in the room . i know exactly where it be leave , on the bed closest to the balcony under the pillow closest to the balcony . when i finally have an opportunity to contact the hotel , i be tell 1 the room be not occupy & amp ; in fact it be untouched , which have to be a lie . since i be tell our room be book already & amp ; need to be clean & amp ; because we watch housekeep enter the room , by the way . . . . i totally regret leave a big tip for her too . so anyways , pablo who be the front desk manager say he look for my property . we speak several time over a couple week , when he say he ' d be move it up to the hotel manager , felipe who call me & amp ; leave a message state `` call me back , so i can send you your tablet . we have a couple of them , i want to send you the right one. `` after 4 to 5 call back within over a week , i get no answer & amp ; no call back . i contact pablo again . he then advise me he ' d be escalate my issue to the top . so i have some other guy call me who state they ' ve turn in to their insurance company & amp ; they ' d be contact me very soon . well after approximately 20 phone call back & amp ; forth over the course of a month . . . . i finally receive a letter from their insurance company , willis tower watson who advise me . . . . . . . it be not cover by their insurance . and pretty much , i ' m shit out of luck . bullshit ! i will not be return to this `` resort '' & amp ; either will anyone i know . . . . . i will also be advise the group that bring 100 ' s of customer to their establishment in order to attend their event that they need to consider one of the surrounding resort , not this one who employ thief !",0,1089
"check in/ check out : we get there around noon ( check in be around 3 or 4pm ) , but they let u check in early . we get our own magnetize card with our name , too . you actually don ' t have to physically check out . you can simply leave , if you want to avoid the line . the room : i book a room for 6 , and it be a family suite in the starlight . luckily for u , it be right next to the pool and waterslide , a well a the lobby . there be two queen size bed and a sofa bed , and each one fit two people . there be a small kitchenette with a sink and mini fridge , a well a cabinet space . a partition separate the sofa bed/ kitchenette area from the queen beds/ bathroom area , which we take advantage of on sunday when half of u watch the game of throne finale . there be also two flat screen tv ( one in each section ) . the bathroom be break up into three part . one for the toilet , an open middle area where there be a sink/ mirror , and then the shower . there be also a closet , safe , and several area clothes could be place in drawer . the room be comfortable enough , with the bed on the firmer rather than plush side . the room be also pretty quiet . you could hear people talk a they walk by outside , but you couldn ' t hear people in the next room . there be also an option to have an adjoining room , which would be great for two large group who want to be close to each other . transportation/ parking : parking cost a pretty penny here , so i would recommend not do it . they offer free shuttle to the park , and those be pretty efficient . i think they schedule be 7am- 2am every day , and the shuttle seem to run every 5 minute . an airport shuttle be available , but it wasn ' t free . i think my friend say it be something like $ 30 round trip . the ground : there be so much to do ! there be the lazy river ( where you could sit on a tube and let the `` current '' take you ) , several outdoor pool ( one with an awesome water slide ) , and even a big screen movie show at night poolside . there be game you could play , like pool ( with the billiards ) or volleyball . i think i may have even see a grill ? the ground be great for an evening stroll , with well- lit path and large table where you could sit and play chess or checker ( though you have to have your own piece ) . there be `` cabana '' area you can reserve , which have chair and a tv . there ' s also a bowling alley ( though kind of expensive at $ 15 per person ) , starbucks , and several indoor food option . pro : - they give u plenty of extra towel and toiletry . service be very prompt and always do with a smile . - can get into wizarding world an hour early with your hotel key card . - love the bold , bright color of the hotel . they have a lot of cute 60 décor throughout the hotel . - the hotel look relatively new , so everything seem to be shiny and hasn ' t accrue that grimy look hotel tend to get over the year . - while crowd , the pool area be never exceptionally so . we be able to enjoy the pool without worry about step on a kid . - the water slide in the pool be awesome ! ( it close at 10pm , though ) - let u check in about 3 hour early . - they offer free basic wi- fi . con : - the magnetic key card suck . we have to get them reprogrammed 4- 5 time . they tell u to keep them away from our cell phone and credit card , and neither of those be near my key card when it deactivate . - they charge for park . initially , they tell u they be waive the fee , but when we check out , we get a $ 50 bill . if you have a season pas , i suggest you park at the park , since i believe parking be free in that case . - they didn ' t have any free medical kit . i ask if they have an aspirin , but they tell me to go to the shop in the lobby . - initially i purchase this hotel because i think it include the fast pass . the website weren ' t really clear on the fact that it doesn ' t. - there isn ' t any complimentary breakfast , but we bring a griddle and make egg every morning , so we be good . - a free airport shuttle isn ' t available . the verdict : i have a blast here ! i do wish they have be a little clearer that while this be an on- site resort , it ' s consider a budget resort , and doesn ' t include express pass . though to be fair , we really didn ' t end up need them . the ground be well- maintain , new , and adorably retro . i love retro style , so the style be right up my alley . despite be a `` budget '' resort , this place have a lot of really fun activity to do on- site , and they provide free shuttle service to the park . i would stay here again , because we all have so much fun at this place for the two night we stay here . honestly , i would rate it closer to 4 . 5. they really shouldn ' t have say they would waive the parking fee , then come around and charge u anyways for it .",1,1080

"we stay at this resort this past weekend . we be there a an owner referral take a tour of the timeshare with the intent to purchase . i will start with the beginning of this horrible stay and walk you through the whole terrible visit . first let me start off with say when i book the room i be tell it be a one bedroom with a king size bed and a queen size pull out couch , but i will get to that in just a moment . we pull onto the property a direct by our gps the gate we arrive at be block off and a security guard lazily walk over and remove a cone for u to cross over the construction zone to get into the property . we ask for direction to the welcome center and he say um yeah i think it be about four stop sign up that way . really this be how you start off a prospective buyer visit . . . . we arrive at the welcome center and it be pure chaos , noisy people try to grab your attention with every step . not at all the calm you look for at a resort for a vacation . we be check in and tell where our room be . i inquire about wifi , but be tell it only work on two device per room . really ! ! we be a family with two teenage child what kind of craziness be this this be the first resort i have be to which do not have wifi include in the package . we drive to our room and unload all of our bag take the elevator up to the third floor walk down to the end of the hallway open the outer door then try the inner door which be lock with a deadbolt . the room we be give have be double book . we haul all of our thing and our child back to the truck and drive back to the welcome center . . . still noisy and chaotic . . . walk up to the front counter and the girl behind the counter say `` oh no what ' s wrong '' another gentleman from behind her rush up and say i have their key for them . no apology , no offering to make thing right , not even a free drink at the tiki bar . nothing be offer to u to make up for their mistake . i be so feed up at this point i be about to leave but i decide to try and give them the benefit of the doubt and give the resort a shot . we finally arrive at our room which be now right next to a construction zone with very limited parking and not a parking place in sight . we end up park up the hill in front of a whole different building . we open the door to our room and i immediately think this have to be a joke . we be put in a cubicle of a room . the master bedroom be a double bed which be hard a a rock . the pull out couch even smaller . the couch have a rip in the leather which someone try to sew up with twine . the sheet be not soft and actually make u all itch . now everyone in my group be ready to pack up and leave , but with the threat of be charge full price for this crappy place we decide to stick it out . here be a few of the highlight of our room : shower have mold grow in the tile on the floor of the shower , also mold grow on the ceiling of the shower . the shower leak during each shower which leave a huge puddle on the ground needing to be clean up , but there be only three towel so we be already short a towel to begin with . there be no dishwasher even though in the update model they try to sell you on have one . by the way if you look at the updated model it have green drape . not one other room in the whole complex have those drape . all of the other room have the same horrible drape a the room we stay in . if you follow this logic the only room they have update be the two they show you during the sale pitch . the cornice in our room be loose so whenever the people in the room next to u who share the outside door with our room leave the entire wall would shake . these people decide to leave the first morning at 4 : 30 be the next morning the let u sleep in until 6 : 00 be . there be suppose to be a complimentary trash pick up between 9 : 30 be and 10 : 00 be , but they do not pick up the trash in front of our unit so that even i get to see a raccoon rip the bag apart of our neighbor trash and carry it away . during the sale pitch which you be force to listen to or be charge over $ 1000 for a three night stay we be show a lovely room which i would have be happy to stay in , but like i say previously this room do not exist for the average guest . i ask what be the time line and be tell they have just start a 36 month remodel and 1/ 4 of the unit be complete . this be a lie . like i previously state if you look at the room you will see all of them have the same drape . if any of the other room have be remodel they would have similar drape to the one show in the sale pitch . this place be a sham and i would not purchase from this resort ever . my family and i be highly disappoint with our entire stay . thankfully we be able to leave the resort to have fun because be in our room make u depress",0,1061
"first of all , let me begin by say that i ' m no stranger to hotel . one of my first job ever be a housekeeper for a hotel chain , and my first job when i move to chicago be front desk supervisor for a 4 diamond golf resort in the suburb . so , when i usually stay at a hotel , i tend to nitpick because i know how it work behind the scene and how it ' s suppose to be do . that say , this place be damn near perfect . great location . . . minute from the airport , seaworld , aquatica , and discovery cove , close to shopping and dining , and around the corner from a publix grocery store and a walgreens . the `` welcome center '' be absolutely beautiful . . . elegant , comforting , and invite . the staff be the most friendly i ' ve ever encounter . the ground be absolutely gorgeous . . . it have the feel of a far more expensive resort . stunning courtyard , simple yet exotic architecture and color , flower everywhere , perfectly position palm tree . . . whoever design the layout and landscaping of this place be a genius . the pool be great . . . plenty of room to allow kid to play and adult to relax . there ' s a splash pad and sandy beach area for the kid , and a large lap pool , hot tub , and plenty of deck chair and lounger for the adult . the bar be right there , and it feature live entertainment every night . and even if there ' s too much action at the main pool for you , you don ' t need to worry ; there ' s a second pool in the middle of the property that ' s much more laid back . they even call it the `` quiet pool '' . : ) right next to the pool and bar be the marketplace . here , you can find everything from pastry to ben & amp ; jerry ' s ice cream to beach towel and sunscreen . the best part ( for me , at least ) be they have a small starbucks inside . unlike other resort , they don ' t just brew starbucks coffee . . . they can whip up just about anything a regular starbucks can , include espresso beverage , hot or iced . and it ' s good , too ; i go to starbucks every morning and get myself a latte , and the marketplace ' s latte be just a good , if not better than , a `` real '' starbucks . near the marketplace , they have a small arcade . around the corner be the welcome center , which have a business center , fitness center , and a small dvd- dispensing machine similar to redbox where you can rent dvd . the concierge be there , too , and man be he fabulous ! he recommend a couple off- the- beaten- path beach for u and print u up direction . he be so friendly and knowledgeable . . . definitely a good resource ! another cool thing be garden grocer , which be a grocery service similar to peapod . you pick out your grocery online , and they ' re wait for you in your suite when you check in ( or whichever time you set up ) . this be very convenient . now , the room . . . we get a 2 bedroom condo on the 5th floor overlook the main pool area . i be a little worried about noise , but it be perfect . the room itself have just about everything you could possibly want . . . two bedroom , two full bathroom ( one with a two- person jacuzzi tub ) , a full kitchen with dishwasher , a full dining room , living room with flat screen tv and dvd/ vcr player , small table and chair on the balcony with ceiling fan . . . and the furniture be sooooo comfortable ! i be really worried about get to sleep in an unfamiliar bed , but it be so comfortable , i not only pass out , but i wake up 6 hour later completely and fully rest ( i usually need 7- 8 hour of sleep ) . the balcony be my favorite part . i would wake up before the pool open , sit out on the balcony with coffee or a cup of orange juice and my laptop , and check my email or read the news and watch the staff clean the pool ( which they do every morning ; that pool be sparkle ) . although most of the resort have only wire internet access , i be able to get the wifi signal from the marketplace on my balcony . at night , i would sit out on the balcony or just leave the door open ( it be cool enough to go without ac ) and listen to the live music and the people laugh and splash . very relaxing and enjoyable : ) there be only a few thing i would recommend to make this resort even better : 1 ) toilet seat be uncomfortable and cheap . they should be replace . 2 ) the room don ' t have steak knife . kind of an oversight . 3 ) the bathroom need more towel rack and place to dry your bath suite . other resort have retractable line you can pull out over your shower or bathtub and hang your bath suite from . this would be a really convenient addition , especially with how much you ' re bound to use the pool area . 4 ) an onsite spa would be fabulous ! ! ! other than these really small thing , this place be absolutely perfect ! bottom line : clean , safe , comfortable , relax . big suite , and nearly every possible convenience onsite . i ' ve never encounter a better place to stay ! ! !",1,1058
"i research a ton of place before decide on this one for our trip . we be look for a place that could accommodate a larger group , one that be near universal , have free breakfast , and offer free park and/ or shuttle service . after find a deal on expedia , i finally decide on this one . i read a bunch of yelp review for the place i be look at , a well a tripadvisor . so while yelp rat this hotel at 2 . 5 star with 10 review , expedia/ tripadvisor rate it at 3 . 9 ( 84 % of people would recommend it ) with over 2 , 000 expedia verify review . i be look for a place that be between 3- 4 star , so nothing extremely fancy , and this place deliver . the kitchen & amp ; live roomwe rent a suite for 7 people . we have two separate room , one with the bed , and one with the kitchen/ live area . the kitchen include a full- sized fridge , microwave , two burner stove , a sink , cabinet , dish and silverware , and even a mini dishwasher . the two burner stave didn ' t work well- - the eye be crook , and they weren ' t able to heat up much even when turn to a high setting . i love not have to worry that my food would go bad , and be able to save money by buy grocery instead of eat out every meal . our liquor also stay cold . the living room have a sofa bed , small flat screen tv , upholstered chair , and a table with several chair . there be also blackout curtain behind the sofa bed . the thermostat be locate in here , and we mostly keep it around 71. the kitchen/ living room area tend to be a few degree warmer than the bedroom . if you ' re thinking of bring a queen sized mattress , one will fit in this area . also , the tv be situate at an odd angle not conducive to watch when sit on the sofa . the bedroomthis be separate by two door , each that could be keep open or close . one door lead to the bathroom and one to the living room . there be two queen bed , a small desk and chair , and a small flat screen tv . there be blackout curtain on the window . it tend to be a bit chillier in here than the other area of the suite . the bathroomthere be two part to the bathroom . one have a sink and mirror , with one door lead out to the bedroom , and one door lead to the kitchen . you could lock both of these door for privacy . the other part of the bathroom have a shower and toilet . this be nice , because someone could take a shower while someone else be brush their teeth in the other part . the water pressure be good , and a far a i know , it be never very cold . they provide only two towel , so i recommend get extra if you have the suite . pro : - the bathroom separate into two area , one with the toilet/ shower and one with the sink/ mirror . - a 10- 15 minute drive to/ from universal . - store and restaurant be nearby . - full- sized fridge , microwave , mini dishwasher , and dish provide in the suite . - blackout curtain . - the room have a thermostat , so we be able to easily adjust the temperature . - staff be nice and accommodate . they even let u check in waaaay early before head to universal . - free parking for hotel guest . ( we park three car there. ) - not only be the wi- fi free , but it work well . we be able to stream music , movie , and music video without any problem at all for most of the weekend . ( password : mickey ) - the suite accommodate our group well . - have a bunch of tv channel i never watch : hbo , food network , etc . we do end up watch the oscar while in our room . con : - you have to book a shuttle 24 hour in advance . - no airport shuttle . - breakfast be pretty weak , even for a free breakfast . they serve these thing regularly : 4 type of cereal , banana , yogurt , pb & amp ; j , and egg . they offer ham one day , sausage and waffle one day , and ham and waffle one day . waffle be stale and unappetizing , sort of reminiscent of reheated frozen waffle that have be reheat a half dozen time . sausage and ham be okay . they be often out of bagel and bread . - the restaurant sound good , but have some of the worst food we ' d ever try . we order nacho that be stale and crumbly , and honestly they smell like cleaning product . the cheese on top of it taste like nothing . literally nothing at all , so it be also probably outdated . the verdict : the breakfast leave much to be desire , but the staff be friendly and the suite itself be a great size for our large group . we be even able to put an additional air mattress in there . it ' s close to universal , have free parking and wi- fi for hotel guest , and be also close to a bunch of restaurant and store . the entire suite be fairly clean , and we definitely didn ' t see any case of bug , evident stain , or shabby furniture . i would stay here again with a group , but i like try out different hotel each time i ' m in orlando , so who know if i ' ll come back .",1,1055
"this hotel be a huge disappointment . i initially give it 3 star , but only because the staff be , for the most part , helpful and friendly . unfortunately , a my stay progress , thing continue to go downhill . for starter , and most importantly in my eye , they place several charge on my credit card for no reason . my employer pay for my room , however , a expect , i have to place a credit card on file to cover any incidental . unbeknownst to me , because they never say a word about it , this place a $ 50 temporary hold on my card . well , i ' ve never experience that at a hotel before , but ok. . . . i can understand it . however , they charge me a second $ 50 hold , and then inexplicably , also charge me a $ 247 . 50 temporary hold . when i question the front desk about it , she say they ' ve be have issue with their system overcharge people , and she go to get the manager . the manager never come out to talk to me , instead the front desk clerk come back and take the telephone number for the credit card company off of my card and say that they have to fax a release form to them in order to reverse the hold . . . . . but that they may not be able to do that for several day . grant , this be a temporary hold that should , presumably , just expire and disappear without ever actually charge me the money , however the unexpected hold cause me to have insufficient available credit to rent the car i have reserve for my stay ( there ' s an avis rental office in the hotel ) . in order to actually rent the car , i have to make an unplanned payment on my card to cover the false charge from the hotel , but that take a day to post , so i be stick without a car that night , which impact my plan for the weekend . thankfully , the hotel have a complimentary shuttle that will take you anywhere within 5 mile . except when the driver call out sick on a friday night , because apparently no one else be capable of drive the shuttle ( it ' s just a freaking van ) . the clerk tell me to just take a cab , which be fine , except i end up pay for a service that be suppose to be include in my room fee . the facility itself be in serious need of maintenance . while my room be ok - nothing spectacular - the public area leave quite a bit to be desire . the restroom sink be miss handle , the trash be overflow and look like it hadn ' t be empty in a week . a for the room , there be no available outlet near the bed to plug in a cell phone charger , which be simply unacceptable nowadays . i have to unplug the alarm clock in order to plug in my phone . tv service be shoddy , with only a handful of channel , most of which have a weak signal and we ' re fuzzy at time . the wall have some small hole in the drywall , the wall be mark up , the furniture be ding . all minor cosmetic issue , but certainly not consistent with the `` grand experience '' that they bill it a . a for the staff they be all friendly , but i do have a few other issue with them . for one , i ask the front desk for a gas station within walk distance so i could grab a few item . the front desk send me to a 7 eleven that be `` 5 to 10 minute walk '' . problem be , it be actually 3 mile away . can any of you walk 3 mile in 10 minute ? to compound matter , there be a 7 eleven about 1/ 2 mile away , albeit across a busy and dangerous highway . perhaps the concierge simply didn ' t want to send me across the highway , but i walk a mile in the dark before turn back when i realize i be nowhere near a store . my reservation include full breakfast , but i never receive instruction on where to go to eat breakfast . i assume it would be in the cafe area in lobby , but the hostess / waitress work there have no idea what i be talk about . i ask at the front desk but the woman there also have no idea whatsoever about the included breakfast . i end up pay for breakfast but be able to rectify the situation later in the day when i find out that free breakfast be , in fact , in the lobby cafe ) . to compound that , the next morning it be the same waitress/ hostess work , and when i tell her that breakfast be include in my room rate , she check a list that have room number that be entitle to free breakfast ! how do she not know that the day before ? ? ? further , i call for room service one night , and they be out of numerous item on the menu . this be just poor planning , particularly consider that i be here for a large conference with over 200 attendee . i would suspect that they would have be prepare for the increase food need . on a positive note , the an tobar irish pub that be attach to the hotel be very nice , although their food menu be very limited . tl ; dr , if you have an option , i would stay elsewhere . i stay here because the work related conference i be attend be hold here , but next time , i ' ll likely stay somewhere else .",0,1049

"i saw this hampton inn list for $ 79 per night on expedia , and though it be only rat a a 2 1/ 2 star property , it be show a be only 3 mile from the orange county convention center where i be attend a trade show and it have lot of strong review on yelp and a few other site , so i book it . personally i think this hotel be a good value for the price pay , but i wouldn ' t rate it any higher than a strong 3 and i ' m not plan to rush back here on my next trip to orlando . this hotel be only a few year old and be in very good condition both inside and out . it ' s also a short drive from the convention center , sea world and a few other attraction . room be well appoint with a desk/ table , a microwave , refrigerator , a flat screen tv and a single cup coffee maker with a selection of regular and decaf coffee and tea . they also provide a `` lap desk '' which be a small wooden table with a vinyl cushion on the bottom that allow you put this on your lap and rest your laptop on it so you can work while in bed . bathroom have good quality , modern solid wood vanity with granite top ; boutique shampoo , conditioner and moisturizer be provide . this hotel also offer coin operate laundry , a fitness room , swim pool and complimentary breakfast . so why only 3 star ? while this hotel be a relatively short drive from many thing , it ' s locate in a business park , so there be no dining or nightlife option anywhere within a reasonable walking distance , and the immediate vicinity of this hotel be basically a ghost town for much of my time here . the `` fitness room '' be quite small and be only outfit with an elliptical machine and 2 treadmill . the swimming pool be relatively small , there ' s no hot tub , and it ' s locate right on the parking lot with absolutely no shade , so it ' s not the type of pool area where one would come to relax and unwind at the end of a busy day . though the hotel be only a few year old , the room be show sign of age . there be lot of black scuff mark on the wall in the room i be in , large crack have open up in both the floor tile and the grout in the bathroom which appear to be from this building settling . the large mirror that they ' d instal a a closet door be flimsy , and wobble about when you ' re opening and closing it , and the bathroom sink be clog . the globe be also miss from the lighting fixture in the bathroom so the light bulb be expose . the wireless internet , while free , be quite slow in my experience . lastly , the room i stay in be le than sound proof . more than a few time i be awaken by people sing or talk in the hallway outside , and the sound of water rush through drain pipe that must ' ve be locate above or adjacent to my room . i also find the staff to be a bit odd . when i arrive , i be the 3rd person wait to be check in , but of the 3 staff behind the counter only 1 be wait on customer and get people check in , while the other two chat away for a while , then walk back into the office and didn ' t so much a greet any of the guest that be wait in line . on the second evening of my stay , i try to call one of my colleague ' room from a house phone locate near the rear exit of the hotel . his room number have a zero in it , and somehow when attempt to call him , i dial the front desk . i apologize , hang up , and a i be walk back to my room , i notice that the front desk attendant have move out into the lobby and star me down a i walk back to my room . on the morning i be depart , i saw that checkout time be at 11. since i be meet some friend for an early dinner in fort lauderdale that night , i be hop to stay in my room until noon to get some work do before leave . i call the front desk , the woman hit a few button on her computer and tell me she could not offer late check out , but when i ask , she do agree to allow me to remain in my room until 11 : 15 so i could wrap up a few thing i be work on . my phone rang promptly at 11. . . it be another hotel employee call to remind me that check out be at 11 , but i still have my `` do not disturb '' sign out . i explain that i ' d speak to the desk and that they grant permission for me to remain there until 11 : 15. when i do exit my room , the cleaning lady be stand in the lobby down the hall with her cart , chat to the employee at the front desk and watch the entrance to my room . a soon a she saw me leave , she follow in behind to service the room . base on these experience , the employee here seem a bit odd , or perhaps this hotel be so small that they don ' t have enough to keep them occupy . nice hotel , good value for the cost , but i wasn ' t exceptionally thrill or wow by my experience here .",1,1040
"* * * and back down to 1 star due to lie by the management . they do not comp u the 1st night nor do they intend too . incompetent , mislead and not worth the saving for fear of not have a hotel room a reserve or the privacy you should expect when use the do not disturb . zero trust leave for this particular doubletree . * * * previously i have upgrade to 3 star after hubby speak to the manager . see our experience in my previous review below : this review have be upgrade to 3 star a the hotel have give u a free 1st night and a reduced 2nd night in return for the computer glitch result in u be lock out of our room and the maid enter the room despite the privacy , do not disturb sign . still not pleased that zero communication happen despite the fact that they have our cell number on file and email . the only time we be make aware of this snafu be after complain about the maid entering ( they do not say a word when they give u new key or explanation a to why it happen . very poor way to handle a problem their computer caused. ) earlier review : hiltons honor member here and i be very unhappy . a i type this , i be lock out of my room wait for my hubby to get the key situation fix . this be our 2nd night here and the key work fine yesterday so this be an issue they cause . we be pay up . after a long day at the park and dinner plan shortly , who have time for this ? also , we be in one of the nicest room they offer , generally reserve for hh member and i expect better from a renovated hotel . while the room look tidy and smell fresh , the carpet and the pullout sofa be stain and the sofa be not something i choose to sit on . the bed be clean and freshly launder . the area under the long bathroom counter be either stained or hasn ' t be scrub in a while . right up until we be lock out , i be wait before leave a review a the staff here be very nice and accommodate but frankly , i expect more . be a floridian , who travel to the key and obscure motel , i be use to smaller scale operation where thing be not 5* * * * * but yet still sweet . old school . it ' s a florida thing and it ' s usually charm . however , when i deal with the hilton brand , i be use to much nicer for my money . most double tree be awesome , this one have not be for our recent trip . well used convention hotel , the room look tire , not renovate . add to that , inoperable elevator and that mean wait in line to get on ( 16th floor so no thank you stairs ) with be lock out , lack of communication from the staff , i also find the customer service staff incompetent . hopefully i will get into my room soon and hopefully my belonging be still untouched . not happy at all ! this be an experience i win ' t readily repeat ! * * * 1st update : i be now in our room . no explanation , just an apology . no good enough ! they also go into our room despite the do not disturb sign . i be beyond angry . this be a one star joke hotel . 3 star prior to the lock out and violation of our privacy . * * * 2nd update : manager explain what happen when hubby go down to discuss the privacy issue . apparently their system lose the detail of our reservation . instead of contact u by phone or email , they automatically check u out . the maid believe the room would be empty so she/ he be simply do their job . the manager be inform that our luggage , etc . be still in the room and yet they still do not contact u to find out why . ( at no point be we contact about a problem ) we have the email confirm the reservation date but the glitch cause computer issue . the manager offer comp to make up for the inconvenience and want u to know this rarely happen and we should not be worry about privacy in our room . we be currently wait to see when this go through on our credit card . last update ( this update no longer apply a the management be false in what they promise below . shameful ! ) i would be willing to give this hotel a 2nd chance should we need to go to a convention or need to save money . normally we would stay at the hard rock for the free unlimited express pass and convenience of citywalk but at peak rate and season pick up , we just want to pop in and not pay big rate . a florida season pas holder , hotel fee get up there a we go often and we don ' t mind save money and standing in line on some trip . i truly felt that the hotel management be extremely embarrassed and apologetic . for this i believe perhaps they win ' t repeat the way they handle this . we be charge $ 70 after tax for the 2 night we stay so they really comped u an a big apology . should a future stay go far better , etc . i will gladly raise the star on my rating but until then , this be a convention hotel and a convenient place to stay for easy walk distance to the park and citywalk and you should expect the quality to be a expect for that .",0,1037
"my boyfriend book a room at aloft for my birthday weekend . we pick aloft because of the convenience to the venue for a music festival we be attend . the best part be that they accept dog . the room be ok. it be cramp but the fluffy comforter , king size bed , small refrigerator and the stand- up shower be nice . they have bliss product in the shower . there wasn ' t a great view or much of a sit area . the best part of the stay , which be the only reason i give an extra star , be that redbull provide a free shuffle service to the venue our first day . i know they weren ' t affiliate with the aloft but it be still awesome for allow redbull to provide the service . aloft only allow valet parking . i really didn ' t like the fact they didn ' t allow self- parking . if they charge $ 20/ day for parking , i think we should have the opportunity to self- park . they wouldn ' t even allow u access to car without bring the car around . the thing that will probably prevent me from ever stay at aloft again have to do with the management . we bring our two dog . the staff be friendly and even give them doggie biscuit in the lobby . after we check in , we crate our dog and leave for the music festival . on our way back , my boyfriend notice he receive a message from the hotel . the message state there be several guest ' complaint about our dog stomp and bark . we didn ' t get the message until we be get back because we didn ' t have service at the festival . we didn ' t understand why our dog would act like that because it be out of character and we be naturally concern . my boyfriend run into the lady manager that work at night . she state that there weren ' t any actual guest ' complaint . it be an observation that be make by an employee walking by the room when he be attend to another unrelated complaint against another guest . then she make a veiled threat that they will have actual non music festival guest tomorrow and we sign the waiver regard the dog . she leave it at that . we be angry but we leave it at that even though we have proof they outright lie to u on the voicemail . we just want to enjoy the rest of our weekend . it be my birthday weekend after all . around 2am , the guest next door and their ten or so occupant come back . they be make so much noise they wake u up . they sound like they be bang around , shout and scream in our room . our dog bark when they feel threaten or harass . if they be stomp around like that at their `` pre- party '' before they go out , i wouldn ' t blame our dog to bark at these people . our dog probably think they be break into our room . i be wonder what the manager mean by our dog `` stomp '' around . our dog be crate and couldn ' t stomp anywhere . these same guest that wake u up at 2am make so much noise around 3 or 3 : 30am , my boyfriend call the front desk to complain . that be the second time they wake u up . to aloft ' s credit , they take care of the issue immediately . i ' m pretty sure the guest be still in full party mode because they be so loud around 8am , they wake u up again . at that point , we just stay awake and look at breakfast option . instead of complain about our dog that no guest complain about at 8 : 30pm when people be either at the festival or get fully load to go out , get a handle on your unruly guest when people be try to sleep at 3 : 30am . the next day , we just relax most of the day . by nature , we be respectful of others so we run several test with our dog where we leave the room and quietly listen from the elevator and lobby . we also stake out our floor ' s lobby and hung out for 45- 60 minute while people walk through and we never hear a peep from our dog . we know what the manager say be pure shenanigan but do it anyway . we run into the same lady manager a we be check out . she tell u about some doggie happy hour they be have later that day . we really do not understand nor care for aloft ' s passive aggressive attitude when it come to pet . if you don ' t like pet in your hotel , just advise they be not allow . we would have be beyond upset if we get that message earlier in the night that first night think our dog be disturb guest and leave the festival early . we pay $ 600 for our festival ticket so tell me how you would have handle that aloft if we receive that message earlier and leave the festival early that first night over a lie ? aloft , you need to teach your manager some manner and some customer service skill because at least one of them have absolutely none . we pay almost $ 300 per night to stay at aloft and never ask for anything except to ask the staff to have the noisy neighbor to quiet down at 3am . i know this be probably an isolated incident but it leave a nasty taste for any aloft property .",0,1016
"wow ! where do i begin since start to finish be terrible ! if i could give 0 , even negative star , i would . beware of this hotel a they have thief work on their staff . i stay here this past weekend for 1 night on july 16- 17. the check in be bad but , have other issue not arise , i would not even be leave a review period . this will be a long review but i believe the whole story be need . when leave to go to the park on saturday , i be look for a safe to put my 7 year old son ipad . there be no safe in sight ( i later find out there be one in the drawer ? ? ? ) so i slip it under the mattress . we return from the park at about 12 . 30 be . obviously exhaust from be in the park all day , i look under the mattress to make sure it be still there and it be so i get into bed and go to sleep . at that point i should have just place it into my bag since i be check out the next day but i be so tired , it didn ' t cross my mind at that point . we wake up , pack our bag , some go down for breakfast and some stay in the room to finish packing . we leave the room at 11 : 30am and head to epcot , which be maybe 10 minute away . once we park and get out of the car it hit me that i forget to grab the ipad from under the mattress . i get back in my car and immediately call the hotel . ( big mistake a i believe that ' s when it be take ) to let them know that i leave my ipad and if they could please have a manager head up to get it . this be at 11 : 55am ( 25 minute after i leave the hotel ) the girl alexis at the front desk say she would call the manager and call me a soon a they get it . i wait 10 minute , no return call , so i call her back and she tell me she be check with the manager . she come back on and that ' s when she tell me that there be no ipad in the room . hmmm . . . really ? 25 minute after i leave the hotel , the ipad be suddenly go ? i ask to speak to a manager and she transfer me to room service voicemail . i call back and say i want the manager and a live person not a voicemail . she place me on hold for 8 minute , no one ever come back on the line so i hang up , call police and go back to the hotel . a i be pull into the hotel , the manager leave me a voicemail say that he go up to the room pull up all the mattress and there be no ipad there . i go inside , tell alexis who i be and she go and tell the manager i be there . after 10 minute , he still do not come out to see me . i have to go back to the desk and say . . . umm . . . shouldn ' t the manager show some respect to his guest and come see me ? apologize ? tell me that he ' s look into it ? ? something instead of hide behind his office door ? ? ? she go back and tell him that i be expect him to show face . he come out a few minute later with a big smile on his face tell me that he find my daughter little stuffed panda ( really ? ) but unfortunately there be no ipad . when i accuse that one of his staff member steal the ipad , he tell me that it wasn ' t possible since the room have not even be service yet so the only person that be in the room be his engineer and that be to look for the ipad ! hmm . . weird since the message he leave me say that he go into the room to look but now he ' s tell me his engineer do . well hello . . . could it not have be your engineer ? he deny that it could have be any one of his employee . so needle to say , he then must believe that the ipad grow some leg and walk out of the hotel after 25 minute of me be go . john ( the manger ) be not helpful , he didn ' t offer to look into it for me , he didn ' t even apologize that this happen under his watch . all he do be deny the fact that there be a possibility that one of his staff member steal my ipad . the police show up , i file my report and leave . wait on the police report that i should have in a few day . i will be call corporate tomorrow a well and be hop that we can pull the hallway surveillance . if i have realize it hour later and a new guest have be check in i would take it a a loss . but 25 minute after i leave the room it be go , the only possibility be that they have a thief on their staff . i would avoid this hotel at all cost and if not . . . do not leave valuable in the room . all staff have a key to your room so this could happen at any time",0,1010
"i would never stay in a hotel like this if i have the option , so take the follow with a grain of salt . . . i be attend a conference , and receive a large scholarship from group host say conference , and be here in orlando to accept the award . due to that i be put into the conference headquarters hotel . now i be pretty lay back about my hotel , and the margin where i can become actively unhappy about thing be pretty narrow . i can roll with a pretty horrible place if i make the mistake of be cheap , and have also shell out a great deal of cash when i want something special . what i can ' t handle be spend a ton of money on something really mediocre , and that be exactly what this hilton be : totally mediocre and non unique , and it charge a fortune for everything thats a basic service in other hotel . what make me happy : - everything be very clean , bright , shiny , and new or relatively new- comfy beds- really nice landscape around the pool- the fire pit be very pleasant to sit around in the evening when it `` cool down '' - i do not , but can understand how kiddy would , love the pool areawhat annoy me : - have to pay $ 13 a day to park my car . your parking garage be empty , even now when the hotel be fully book ! add insult to injury , in this heinously touristy yet middle of nowhere part of `` orlando '' we be surround by literally mile of empty field and half empty road ( conveniently with no space for street parking ) . we be not in an environment where space be remotely at a premium . they be simply screw a small percentage of their patron to make a little more $ $ . - a one way shuttle to the airport be $ 19 per person . it cost me $ 12 per day to rent a car for four adult . even with their astronomical parking price , it still cheaper to rent a car just to get back and forth to the airport . i believe cab be no more than $ 30 , since when be a cab cheaper than a hotel shuttle ? - be charge over $ 10 per day for wireless . it 2011 , if i be pay more than $ 150 to stay at your hotel and you be not a bed and breakfast run by an elderly couple , it be unbelievable that you charge for wireless access ! ! - the food be mediocre to awful , and overprice . i actually take picture of the room service food charge i be so shocked . on top of exorbitantly high base price , ( a basic continental breakfast be $ 25 ) the price for delivery be $ 4 . 50 plus a 22 % gratuity . huh ? how many time can you screw a client for one service ? - the much advertised pool be stupidly shallow . this hotel host ton of conference , and people over the age of 12 enjoy more than 3 . 5 foot of water in a pool- the lazy river be equip with demon water gun . they make a clicking noise that beg you to turn and look , and then rocket a jet of chlorine in your face . not appreciated- there be nothing remotely unique about this hotel that would suggest it be in florida . if it be not for the landscaping around the pool , you could have literally airlift this hotel from any place in the u . bummer . - the hotel be at the very end of the tourist strip mecca , on the other side of the convention center . other hotel be much closer for walk to restaurants/ bars/ mini golf ( why be there so much mini golf ? ? ) - i have a bad experience with pay for the hotel . basically i be `` share '' the room with another scholarship recipient , who be not arrive for another two day , at which point i be leave . at check in i be force to also pay for her night in the room . simply keep the final night reserve separately under her name ( which the reservation be under in the first place ) , or continue to use her credit card to hold the last night ( her card be already hold the entire hotel stay ) be not acceptable solution to the hilton staff . i be force to put the entire stay on my student credit card , and at $ 209 + tax per night several day put me over my credit card limit , and i be accrue fee a i sit here type . at this point i be ready to just go down the street to a cheaper hotel with free parking and free wireless , but i don ' t want to screw the total stranger whose credit card be hold the room . all in all , i think this place be fine if you want a very comfortable but extremely bland hotel to stay in , and don ' t mind get totally screw when pay for everything . this whole part of orlando be clearly nothing but the world biggest tourist trap . but there be way of be a money extractor that make you a much love icon ( take a hint from your famous neighbor like disney up the street ) , and their be way like the hilton that just piss you off so much you stay up until 1am write a yelp review .",0,998
"quite possibly the worst . . . and most disappointing . . . hotel experience of my life , and i ' m a guy who ' s stay in more than one trucker hotel and be a frequent motel 6 customer . my girlfriend and i go to spend her birthday weekend at disney , and i can honestly say that if it weren ' t for the great experience at the disney park , her birthday would have be a complete bust . this be my best effort at briefly summarize the problem i have with my stay : 1. villa be not a advertise . while it be a nice villa , the villa be advertise to come with a hot tub , in the room , for two people . what we get be a deep bath with some jet in it . . . it be great , but it just wasn ' t a advertised . but that ' s not really the problem . 2. staff could not accommodate our request to check in early . we arrive early ( around 8 in the morning ) after a red- eye flight , a ride on a local city bus ( the orlando transit system get one star , a well ) and a nearly 2- mile walk in the florida swamp weather to the hotel . it doesn ' t bother me that they couldn ' t accommodate u , it bother me that they didn ' t even seem to want to try , they didn ' t even ask the housekeeping staff if a room be ready until nearly 5 hour after we arrive ( 1 pm ) . we have hop to take a nap in our room , instead we nod in and out of sleep in 100- degree heat next to the pool . 3. housekeeping be subpar . the second night we be there , we return from the park ( after a 45 minute bus ride because the hotel shuttle bus driver didn ' t know where she be go , miss her exit , and have to return to the park and try again ) late and go to use our fancy bathtub , only to find a used , dirty sponge sit in the tub . i call the front desk to let them know on the advice of some friend that work in the hotel industry here in la , and be give the run around before finally leave my complaint with someone who claim she be `` in charge '' overnight . the next morning , at six be , i be awaken by an automate wake- up call . . . one that i have not request , a i have every intention of sleep in that morning . we spend the day enjoy the pool , which i ' ll admit be the only positive part of the experience , and return to our room that afternoon to find it have not be clean . i call housekeeping in order to get some fresh towel , which be deliver promptly . a few minute later , a woman whose nametag identify her a the housekeeping manager show up and ask if the room have be clean , to which i reply in the negative . mind you , by this time , it be after 6pm . the room do not get cleaned that day , at all . 4. after all this , i contact an actual manager , and discuss with her all the issue we experience . she offer me a late check- out , which i tell her would not work for u , a our plane leave at 6 : 30 in the morning on our day of check- out . she make no effort to offer anything else to make up for the piss- poor service and experience . 5. the morning of checkout , we go to the front desk and check out . i be give a receipt for room + incidental that seem a bit light . . . so i study it . in review the receipt , i saw that one night ' s stay be $ 0 . 00 , which make me think that the management have do the right thing and comped u for one night . i ask the young lady at the front desk if this be the final total , and even point out to her that the room have be free for the previous night , and she confirm that this be my final total . i ride back to the orlando airport feel much better about the management of the sheraton vistana . upon my return to la , i review my account online and saw that the sheraton vistana hotel have , after the fact not only charge me for the final night , which be disconcert enough , but have charge my card another $ 50 hold for incidental ! ! ! ! ! and when i call to see what be go on , i basically get tell the customer service version of `` oh well , suck for you. `` 6. my girlfriend email the general manager of the hotel after all these issue and itemize the issue we have there . in his reply , he offer to give her 2 , 000 starwood point . we do recieve the point after about a month and apply them towards a substantial discount on a prime sheraton location in new york city . so thank you , sheraton vistana , for help me stay in time square for 180 a night ! in summary , i must say that this resort , while fill with great promise , fail a a hotel . stick with the timeshare business .",0,992

"it ' s hard to ever have a bad time at disney world just beause of the nature of what they do . i guess most people go there for the first time a kid , but a the year roll along and multiple visit occur , it be never quite like you remember it a a kid . disney seem to be push the bottom line more than an interest in you have a good time . in our last visit , it be far too over- crowd at the magic kingdom to be enjoyable . there be very long line and hard to navigate your way around . florida weather : it ' s always a nightmare . i never like go there in the summer . i ' m a northern california guy . we don ' t have high humitdy and heat here , so florida humidity will drain your energy . dining : the restaurant be still much overprice ( you be a captive audience so they don ' t care ) . however , the food quality seem to have improve over the year . the fast food service place have decent food and pricing . the meal plan : it ' s a great concept , yet bad implementtion . it be confuse . we could not use our meal plan on one night a there be no reservation at any restaurant . thus we waste money on meal we could not use . they should allow priority for meal plan user . it save some money though . also , force tipping , and tax ( tax even on the tip ) ! ! ! we end up spend another $ 50 a day . . . . this should all be include in the meal plan . the reason i want a meal plan in the first place be to forget about extra cost . i ' ve always hat forced tip anyway . disney , you have forget that tipping be for the purpose of reward exceptional service . it be not mean to be include to subsidize the lower salary you pay your employee . that be a disgusting , worrisome trend . the staff : the staff be always friendly and superb . they want you to have a good time . the part that always amaze me though be how many attendee can be so rude and mean to the child . i be talk about frustrate mom ' s and dad who scream at their kid and yank them by the arm . folk , why bother to spend all that money to go there if you be just go to ruin your child ' s precious early memory by scream at them ? tobe a little sarcastic here . . . disney , please implement a `` slap plan. `` any time you see a parent scream at their kid or yank them by the arm , then you should have an attendee slap the hell out of mom and dad . het them know how it feel : - ) transportation : i be bore and tire by have to take disney bus everywhere to move among the park or to the hotel . they do come very often , but it be a hassle that you will not like at the end of a long day . photopass : this be something we win ' t bother with in the fuure . it be not a mature process . photo pas be not consistent . some place be easy to select a photo for your ride , yet some place require payment in advance . two girl form haiti be not train at all . it take 20 minute to find the photo , puchase , and print it . that be a big waste of our time . photo be also too expensive . web site downloads be limit to 8 1/ 2 x 11 '' size . the photopass web site be terribly slow and hang a lot . on screen preview be too small to be able to see problem like who be blink . download of a prepaid photo be only in 4 x 6 format . the site be also confuse with lot of pop- ups. '' can '' photo be too expensive for download . the only way this be even close to be worthwhile be to order the photo cd for a fixed price . we suggest to just use your cell phone for photo . you will actually get better resolution photo than what disney put on the web site for you to buy at a high price . magical express : big star for disney on this one . they get it exactly perfect . if you be come from out of town by airplane , the express bus take care of all your baggage directly from the airline . you simple hop off the plane , get on the bus , and when you arrive at the hotel , the bag be in your room . the same thing occur on your trip to the airport . we need have to deal with our bag when we leave the hotel . the bag be ready when we get back home to our airport . firework : to end of a really positive note : no one do firework like disney . they be absolutely spectacular . also , the castle projection and lead color- change spot on the castle at night be dazzle . in just the last few year , disney have greatly upgrade that night time show and you must see it to believe it .",1,965
"disney world be magical . a few day after my twenty fourth birthday , i finally take myself to disney world . last minute , i be select to attend conference that cover my hotel and airfare , and my mother end up join me for the trip . we have two day to see all of the magic . my number one suggestion be to be organize ! if you don ' t have time to plan a trip to disney , don ' t go . planning be key . we visit magic kingdom , animal kingdom , and epcot in two day in may . fast pass be fundamental . do the research and pick the three ride that be most important to you . get the guidebook and look at the website to determine which rid you should use your fastpass for . once you use your 3 fastpass ride for the day , you can go to a kiosk to select more . also download the disney experience app . you can see the wait time and plan what you will do next while wait in line for another ride . finally , don ' t judge a ride base on the description . certain ride , like living with the land , sound really dumb but be actually cool . and then there be other ride that be totally overrate . try everything if you can . magic kingdom- my mom and i love magic kingdom . we be in the park from 9 be to 11 : 00 pm , and we ride everything except for the seven dwarf mine train , carousel of progress , and the people mover . most adult tell me to skip it , but it be classic disney . we especially love splash mountain and space mountain for the larger ride . for the small ride , small world and under the sea be super cute . my favorite show be the tiki room and hall of president . on the other hand , enchant tale with belle and the adventure of winnie the pooh be pretty awful , and i wouldn ' t go to either again . the electrical parade and firework be not to be miss . food be slightly challenge without a reservation in magic kingdom , but if you do your research , you will find plenty ! there be many place that don ' t take reservation . we enjoy deluxe chicken sandwich a pecos bill ' s and dole whip ' s at aloha isle . both place be reasonably price . animal kingdom- this park seem to be a bit underrated . it be smaller than the other park , but we really enjoy animal kingdom . we only get to spend a morning here , but we love the kilaminjaro safari and expedition everest . dinosaur be super boring . we also really enjoy the finding nemo show . i would love to spend more time here watch the animal and see all of the show . fastpass isn ' t necessary in this park if you be try to do two park in a day . we skip eat in animal kingdom because we want our lunch and dinner at epcot . the food at animal kingdom really didn ' t look too appealing though . epcot- epcot be half food and half ride . soarin be very cool a be spaceship earth , and i be surprise to really enjoy live with the land . we spend a lot of time go around the aquarium , which be also cool . we waste a fastpass on turtle talk with crush , which be not very good . the food part of the park be very fun , and it be cool to walk through all of the shop . we eat in france and germany and enjoy our food very much . germany ' s food be very americanized , which be disappoint . we try `` bratwurst '' sandwich and something that be essentially macaroni and cheese . i enjoy the french food , but i have no idea how authentic it be . we have a ham and cheese croissant , apple and brie baguette , chocolate raspberry mousse , and profiterole ice cream . i really enjoyed france . not have a food plan be problematic in all of the other country . so if i could do it all again , what would i do ? i would definitely like to do this trip a more of a splurge than a last minute budget- strap trip . i only know about three week out that i be go to be in disney , and ideally , i think have 6- 9 month to plan would be perfect . i would stay in one of the moderate , or preferably , deluxe hotel . i would love to stay in the contemporary or polynesian because they have fantastic transportation option . i would come in non- peak season again and strive to find a free dining sale . i would also like to have four full day to see each park , and i maybe would even do 5 so that i could take an early flight and spend an evening in magic kingdom get a nice dinner , see the electrical parade , and watch the firework . if you haven ' t yet have the chance to go to disney and be an adult , you should definitely go . it be one of my favorite trip of all time .",1,950
"i find this place to be just okay . not bad , not great , but just okay . the staff be nice , and the lobby be impressive , but in truth , i don ' t really care much about those thing . i expect a room to have attention to the detail . that be the space i live in while i be there . lake , fountain , and marble be nice , but they aren ' t where i spend my downtime . personally , i find the marriott to be a bit of flash without much substance . it make an impressive first impression , but it that ' s about all . why be i so . . . well , eh ? there be many reason . . . most of them fall into the picky range , but when you add them all up , it make an overall . . . eh impression . picky thing that annoy me : no free wifi in the room . . . in 2013 , you would think a hotel would provide it guest at this price point free wifi . you have to pay for park if you be a guest at the hotel . again , this be a picky annoyance . i completely understand pay for park if you be there to play golf , go to the spa , or you be in an urban location where parking be scarce . . . in a big open greenspace , that last one doesn ' t fly so much . refrigerator be inoperable in the room . i don ' t know if this be because the one in my room be break , or all the refrigerator aren ' t be use because of a safety concern . however , if it be the latter , pull them out of the room . an inoperable fridge give the place a break down vibe . every ( and i mean every ) handle in the entire room be barely attach to the drawer . you know when you ask a person who really doesn ' t want to do a job to attach them and they literally screw it in once . . . yeah . i really don ' t expect to have to screw every handle i want to use in a hotel room to avoid have it come off in my hand . why didn ' t i call ? because that ' s pretty bitchy to call and complain about that . . . but at the same time , it just one of those unsaid thing that should just be do . the toilet do not flush well . i find it ironic they have energy efficient sign about the reusing towel but the toilet have to be flush at least twice . every . single . time . mold . in the raspberry in the breakfast buffet line . seriously . i tell a server and she didn ' t remove them immediately . a cook come out a remove them about 5- 10 minute later , but i be cringe a i watch people go through the buffet line ( and no , no one else take them ) . i be a bit shocked they didn ' t catch the obviously furry raspberry when they be put out . after all of that , the last annoyance be probably sufficient to request a room change , but after all the above , i wasn ' t convince any other room be go to be much better and i could make do , but it be indicative of the cut corner impression i have of the place by this time . the shower wasn ' t seal appropriately . one of the very nice thing about the hotel be they have a separate tub and shower . i be take bath , but the husband take shower . when he be take a shower on his second or third day in the hotel ( i clean up usually before him ) i notice a very steady stream of water flood the bathroom and make him plug up the leak with a washcloth . whoever seal the shower apparently decide it wasn ' t all that important to use caulk all the way down the entire seam . worse , the shower head be in a fixed place where it point directly at the gap . i can not believe we be the first people or even first dozen people to experience that in the room and if it hadn ' t be fix by now , i wasn ' t incline to go through the hassle of point it out , pack up , unpacking , or worse , have workman come in and out when there be a million other place i would rather be on my vacation . so , an appropriately place washcloth plug it up enough to avoid a noah ' s ark theme recreational site . so , like i say , the place be okay . it be clean , the staff be polite , and the location be very attractive . however , i get a major impression that it be mostly veneer and if you scratch the surface a bit , you may find out that it isn ' t a well run a one would hope for a place at this price range . . . but that be just my opinion .",1,939

"just get back from a stay at disney ' s beach club resort with my husband . our trip start at the main entrance . there be a strange interaction with the valet service , i wasn ' t quite sure what vibe i be get . he seem friendly enough , though he come across a a little peeved that we be not take the valet service . at $ 20 buck a day , we ' ll walk . the guest parking be fairly close to the entrance of the hotel , so it wasn ' t a huge inconvenience . once out of our car we be `` welcom [ ed ] home '' immediately . the checkin process be a breeze , no pun intend . there be no line , so we be greet by a friendly reception right away . she explain that we have a room on the 2nd floor the a `` big '' balcony . we request a 3rd floor ( newly renovate ) room per another trip advisor tip . the receptionist explain that the 3rd floor wasn ' t finish be renovate , and that the renovated floor be the 4th and 5th floor , so we request one of those . our request be grant , though we have to trade in our `` big '' balcony for a standing balcony , something we never regret . we be issue our magic band and we be on our way . we make our way down a series of beautifully redecorate , wonderfully smell ( besides a little chemical from remodel ) , hallways to our room . we especially love the smell of the hotel . i read some complaint on tripadvisor and we be not unhappy at all with the smell , it be the perfect smell for a beach themed hotel . once inside our room , we be amaze ay how modernly beach theme our room be . i ' m not a beach theme kind of girl and it be just incredible . i love the crush shell accent on the bed frame , just beautiful . the tile in the shower be gorgeous and whoever have the brilliant idea of use wood tile for the bathroom floor deserve an award . everything be just jaw droppingly , perfectly , well do , right down to the picture of mickey and minnie at the beach , fly a kite . we open our `` balcony '' to find that we have a view of the garden and the boardwalk . it be a little strange , be on our balcony , and look down to see other people on their balcony though . this be a strange design . upon arrival we look for the room service menu , only to find it be miss . we call the front desk and they say they would send one up right away . the room be very clean , though i get a vibe that it be clean in a major rush . item be arrange crook , there wasn ' t a menu , even the mickey towel , on our bed , be off center . this wasn ' t a big deal , it just be something we ' d notice . one thing i will say be that the receptionist be very friendly and handle our call in a timely fashion . we be even grant a late ( 1 : 00pm ) check out , which help make our trip even better . we love sleep in during our hotel stay . they have a great store in the resort that sell gift and grocery item , such a bread , milk , fruit , and lunch meat , which i felt be classy and nice touch for disney to allow . i ' m guess it ' s for the disney villa guest . they also serve warm sandwich , salad , and dessert . we eat dinner at beach and cream soda shop , and it be excellent and affordable ( for disney property ) . we never try the pool , next time ! on a side note , i later find out that our magic band could be make smaller . long story short , it would be nice if the receptionist could go over this with you at the front desk . it only take a few second and it ' s very beneficial for guest . another issue we run into , later on , be that we be tell we ' d reach our limit on spending use our magic band . this couldn ' t possibly be true because it be the first time we ' d use the band . it be a bit embarrassing and inconvenient . luckily we bring a card with u . we never check the band after that and we never call to ask about the misunderstanding . the band work for get into the room with no problem . this be my first time at the resort , though i ' ve stay at the boardwalk a few time . we be very excite to try this resort and , thanks to some tip from fellow tripadvisors , we be not disappointed . aside from some minor setback , we have a wonderful time and we cant wait to recommend this hotel to our friend and family , a well a return ourselves .",1,929
"i be generally a big fan of marriott property , but the gaylord palm , not so much . we attend a conference there from 1/ 29- 2/ 01/ 14. we actually stay in a comfort suit hotel the day before we check in , which should have be much worse , but for a third the price , be better . that should tell you something . start with the online reservation system , it would not let me book for the three of u who be go , only for one person , and it would not let me use my reward point to pay for the first night , so i have to call the hotel . in all fairness , i have never have any trouble with the marriott book system before , so the computer may have just be have a bad day . the hotel be a little pricey , but i have enjoy stay at the gaylord in nashville several time and i figure i would be get great service for my investment . i figure wrong . on arrival , they still have not charge the first night to my reward card , and tell me i have to do it at checkout . at checkout , they tell me i have to do it when make the reservation , i explain to them that i have , but it didn ' t help . it be one of those circular reason thing that make you want to commit hara- kiri on the spot , but i do not bring any traditional japanese sword on which to impale myself . my oversight . the young lady help me at discharge be actually a joy , but be new , and i believe that the worker she consult for help have very low serum xanax level that day , make a great show of how difficult it be go to be to make any change , and remind me frequently that i should have take care of this at the time i make the reservation . i do not even try to explain again , know that i would only confirm her belief that i be a lying old fart try to ruin her day by ask her to complete this monumental task . she have to `` go to the back '' to get this straighten out . i assume there be some sort of reward point wizard back there , because after about 15 minute , the task be at last complete . on to the room , which be smallish , but tastefully decorate and fairly clean . we drop our stuff off and head to the conference . more on the room in a minute . the large main conference room have a sound system that i believe be instal by thomas edison , with the echo and feedback making it almost impossible to hear what the speaker be say . they must have be expect a lot of attendee from alaska , because all of the conference room thermostat be set at liquid nitrogen . by the end of the day my teeth be chatter and my foot be numb . back to the room , where after our night time routine we climb into bed , only to discover that the bed have be purchase at concrete room to go . impossible to sleep in , the only one of u not to get up with a backache each morning be the 5 year old . the pillow be about a bad ; old , worn , hard , and flat . this really seriously impact our trip . on to the price . at about 300 buck a night , a lot of hotel at least do a turndown and put a chocolate on your pillow , or supply you with some comfortable terri- cloth robe . too big an investment for the gaylord , i ' m afraid . the restaurant pretty much all serve 3 star food at 5 star price , thirty- seven buck per person for the mediterranean food resemble buffet . you get can get through the line for only 18 buck if you can convince them that you be five year old . wine price be about 5 time retail . we be not talk about anything close to michelin star restaurant here either . price for snack and drink in the hotel store be actually higher than at the disney resort , so you may have to take out a loan if you want some orange juice . parking be pay , whether you valet or self park , 24 buck a day for valet , plus tip , or 18 dollar per day if you want to park in the suburb and hitch a ride back to the hotel . there be a considerable daily `` resort fee '' which i suppose cover the luxury of indoor plumbing . the atrium be plant with `` lush tropical plant '' , mostly native to florida , and be much le impressive than the gaylord atrium in nashville , or for that matter many of the public park in florida . all in all , a 2 star hotel at 5 star price . don ' t get me wrong , i be all in when it come to pay for quality , but at the gaylord you be simply pay for something you do not get .",0,928
"last minute 2 . 5- day business trip in orlando , early march this year . our meeting be at the walt disney dolphin & amp ; the room block there have sell out by the time i be book , so off to yelp i go to research option . since i travel for work , i prefer somewhere suitable for business travel , over the disney- theme vacation hotels/ resort . wyndham grand bonnet creek look to fit the bill . i arrive late evening , 9pm . i immediately like the feel - contemporary and lux . the front desk be busy and there be 2 other party ahead of me . one of them , it seem , have be wait a while a their room wasn ' t ready when they arrive earlier , and be still not ready at this point in the evening . they be cordial but i could sense their impatience . i shoot them a sympathetic look a i take my turn but soon find myself in the same situation with my room not ready . the front desk offer me a glass of wine in the bar while they finish prepare my room though , personally walk me to the bar , and ask my server to take good care of me . i be prepare for a wait , but by the time i ' d finish my wine , staff have come back with my room key . i love my room . standard non- smoking king that be spacious , clean , and decorate in modern line and color ( mahogany furniture with muted blues/ cream ) and a beautiful stencil on the wall that i make a mental note to copy and replicate in my own home . comfortable bed , full size sleeper sofa , coffee table , flat screen tv , and desk with ample workspace . wi- fi and tv signal be sketchy but not too problematic . there be a little niche space with countertop , refrigerator and coffee maker ( wolfgang puck coffee ) . well- lit bathroom , good- size shower . balcony with view of the parking lot , but i think other room have a nice view of epcot . i saw on their website that they have suite here with bunk bed which would be great for the kid or group . after see how nice my room be , i keep this in mind for possible future stay at disney . there aren ' t any restaurant within close walk distance ( close mean a mile or le ) so i have room service , and order a pizza . room service be quick , the pizza be good ( nothing great ) , and i be able to store leftover in the fridge . the next night i have dinner in tesoro cove , one of the onsite restaurant . service be friendly , food be good ( pasta ) , din space be comfortable , and lean more on the casual side with a nice view of the outdoor patio/ lake around the resort . this be where the morning breakfast buffet be and while i didn ' t get to try it out , i walk past in the morning and the spread look pretty good . wyndham also have a poolside bar , and the more upscale deep blu seafood restaurant . i take a walk around the resort lake one night and run a few lap around the next morning . one lap ' s a little over 0 . 5 mile . the pool area look amazing and i wish i have more time to enjoy it . one area be pirate- themed complete with pirate ship that i know my kid would love . the fitness center be nice and modern too , clean , maintain , with plenty of machine . 24- hour biz center where you can print boarding pass , and a small onsite arcade for the kid . the resort offer kid activity throughout the week ( craft , poolside game ) . the gift shop be well- stocked and pricey , but what you ' d expect in a hotel gift shop . it ' s one of the few non- disney own property in the area and seem easy enough to get to/ from the park . they offer shuttle to the park which i didn ' t use , but seem to run frequently . i didn ' t like that they push town car service on guest . i want a simple taxi to get to- from my mtgs at the wdw dolphin , but on the 2 morning i be here , they tell me taxis would be harder to hail w/ over a 30- min , so i have to take town car to the wdw dolphin . i didn ' t seem to have any issue hail taxi from wdw dolphin though , to come back to wyndham , and the fare be almost twice the price in a town car than in a taxi for le than 1 . 5 mile . overall though , i enjoy my short stay at the wyndham grand bonnet creek , and i will remember this resort when i come back with the family . room rate be comparable to the disney resort and it seem much le hectic here . good for family and business traveler .",1,928

"i really want to give this place a better rating , but they just didn ' t deliver for me . bottom line : the hotel itself be nice look and the pool be very good , but the service be siginificantly below what i be expect for a place get a 4 . 5 star average on yelp . look to me that they put many million of dollar into build the place , but then forget to spend the money to staff it properly . a much a the brick and mortar be impressive , the staff need to be equally a impressive to get a 4 . 5+ star rating . to start : i be apparently invisible for approx . 10 minute upon my arrival by car - - i pull up to the porte cochere ( at approx . 1pm ) and wait behind the one other car in front of me , which be be actively unload . certainly not an overloaded / busy situation with just the one car ahead of me . there be one valet person help that vehicle in front of me and no other help to be find . i wait a few minute and since my existence have yet to be acknowledge , i pull around and park in front of this other vehicle and open my trunk , hop that this would be an obvious signal that a new guest have arrive , but to no avail . i unload my own bag and flag down a second valet person walk by ( i think he be probably on his way to retrieve another vehicle ) and tell him i need help and then he do stop and take my car for valet parking and load my bag on a cart . not the greatest arrival experience , but i be willing to look past this . my room be ready at around 3 : 30pm - - it be in the `` west wing '' . the bellman get our bag and lead u to our room by go outside in 90 degree plus heat and schlepping across a plaza . i would later find out that the west wing be actually connect to the main building and we could have go from the lobby to the room completely inside with air condition . not sure why we go outside through a plaza in oppressive heat or why the bellman fail to mention i could stay inside - - you will see why this point be important a you read on . . . upon enter the room , there be a half empty can of sprite and a half empty mini vodka bottle that someone have take from the mini bar in the room . also , our room be next to an elevator and a loud ice machine . i call the front desk to tell them about the sprite and vodka so i wouldn ' t be charge , and i also ask for a different room due to noise of the ice machine , but the person say they be `` fully commit '' and couldn ' t move u . i go back to the front desk ( walk again through the hot plaza - - not yet know i could have stay in the a/ c the whole way ) and then again request another room . this time , they have another room , but it wasn ' t quite ready yet and they would call me when it be ready , and i say that would be fine . but they say i would need to bring my bag back to the lobby by myself - - they say they know that this be inconvenient , but to please do this , since they didn ' t have anyone that could help . unbelievable . i walk back out outside and across the hot plaza back to my room , pack up , and lug my bag by myself back to the lobby - - again all outside in the blazing sun . when i find out i could have stay in the a/ c the whole time , i be angry ! i catch up with my wife , who have go to the spa for a massage at a cost of $ 180 + automatic 20 % gratuity for a total of $ 216 , but she say it be just ok. she have have better massage for much le . not worth it . i will say the pool be very nice and i like the drink and food at the bar by the main pool , which have a great water slide . one of the big reason to stay at one of the three universal hotel be to get in early to the park . it be important to beat the crowd and this be very helpful . so in summary , i would say to go to this hotel for the pool and to get into the park one hour early . but don ' t come here expect great service . i really do not feel i be treat well for the high cost of stay here . they put the money into build the place , but then get cheap on run it .",0,904
"due to book plane ticket at the last minute , we end up at the suburban extend stay south to compensate for the increase in airfare . i think the rate end up be about $ 52 . 00/ night . naturally for that price , we do not expect a super- nice place . we plan to be out and about during the day so mainly it be just a place to shower and crash at night . i ' m try to be fair with the whole `` you get what you pay for '' and the place have free ( high- speed ) wi- fi , a flat- screen tv , cold air conditioner and a large full- size refrigerator . ( we do not use the stove or microwave. ) we be tell that housekeeping be only once a week and be not schedule during our 5- night stay , but we could request clean towel at the front desk by bring in our old/ dirty towel to trade . ( we do exchange the towel a few time with no problems. ) there be a sign on the refrigerator that say light housekeeping ( empty the trash , change the sheet , etc. ) could be schedule for an additional fee ( if need before the once weekly schedule one ) . by the way , there be no hair- dryer and no iron . now , have say all the above fair/ neutral thing , most likely we will never stay at this hotel again . i ' m okay with thing be `` old '' ( like peel paint , crack in the wall , rusty shower curtain rod , etc. ) , but it be more about lack of cleanliness . for $ 52 . 00/ night i do not expect thing to be `` new , `` but be `` old '' and be `` dirty '' be not the same thing . our ( `` non- smoking '' ) room smell musty and be crawl with roach . i hate squish roach so i manage to kill two that be crawl around the sink by quickly splash them with water and watch them go down the drain . the other one that be crawl on the wall and across the carpet , i try to ignore . i saw that they get into my luggage when i leave it open the first night , so after dump them out , i keep my luggage zip up for the rest of our stay . the carpet do not look like it have be vacuum prior to our check- in ; the bathroom floor do not look like it have be mop . if the floor have be clean , the housekeeper do a very slapdash job . i wear my flip- flop around the room our entire stay because the floor seem so dirty . i always tip the housekeeper at other hotel i ' ve stay at but since there be no housekeeping during our stay and since the room be not exactly clean when we check in , this be the first time i have ever choose not to tip . the worst part of our stay though , be the shady- or sketchy- look character who hang around or reside at the place . we didn ' t feel safe/ comfortable entering and leave our room , and we always take our valuable ( mainly some electronics ) with u every time we leave the room . the first night , we run into some prostitute a we be head to our room . maybe they weren ' t but the way they be dress just scream `` prostitute. `` at 3 : 19 a. m. , we be awaken by someone knock on our door . we didn ' t answer ( and didn ' t dare to pull back the curtain to look out the window ) , and after 30 second or so the person knock again . no , we be not go to open the door in the middle of the night . the knocking stop . the second night , upon return to our hotel around 9 p. m. , we saw four police car and four people be arrested/ handcuffed right below our room . the third night , we be awaken around 4 : 45 a. m. by some screaming/ fight in the room next to ours . every time we leave our room and head to our rental car , we saw shady character just hang around outside their room and star at u . our rental car ( a 2015 model ) be one of the newer car park there and i be always worry about it be vandalize and then we ' d have to pay for the damage ; fortunately , the car be fine during our stay . if you ' re really try to save money and can deal with some roach and shady- look character , you might be okay stay here . if you have young child with you or you prefer a cleaner place , you might want to cough up the extra cash for another place and just eat at mcdonald ' s the rest of your vacation to compensate .",0,901
"i stay at the hotel march 7- 9 , 2016. one room with two separate twin bed . room 305. i don ' t know why this place have only 2 1/ 2 star , this be a great hotel especially for the price . i read a lot of bad review before book this place , so it be a risk but i find this place be not like any of the bad review at all ! the outside be that of a 3- 4 star hotel . and the lobby be very lovely . the room look exactly like in the picture . room 305 have a sub- par view but it doesn ' t matter because we be not even in the hotel except to sleep- in which the blind be close ! the ( black ) lady ( with medium length curly hair ) at the front be really nice and helpful and give u lot of information that we didn ' t even use but be very good to know ( shuttle info , other stuff i can ' t remember ) . she give u her card and tell u to review her on tripadvisor . unfortunately i lose the card ! ( i ' m sorry miss front desk woman , you be awesome with customer service. ) check in be super quick and easy . our room be clean and set up properly . one problem be the shower didn ' t work but we call the desk and they fix it right away . so that be another thumb up . there be a mini fridge ( and microwave too ) ? ! which be very convenient and much appreciate a i bring load of fruit from home for the trip . there be also a hairdryer which be nice for me ! and the a. c. work very well . the elevator be so fast i ' ve never be in such a quick yet graceful elevator , honestly . the hotel be a perfect distance from universal . 15 minute walk , which be very lovely full of nature and one busy bridge that fine though , few stop light to cross , and easy to conquer even after 8- 11 hour of universal walk . we save $ 60 by not drive and park at universal . ( $ 20 a day for park i read online ) . it ' s also a short distance from ihop , but the ihop wasnt very good . if you go to ihop be very clear with the waitress about your order . they probably win ' t remember specific even if you tell them three time clearly , but very nicely . after go to universal , the walk home can seem daunt but me and my boyfriend be motivate by the hot tub they have . there ' s two hot tub separate by a wooden fence for privacy , i guess , and they can really help your foot after a long day of walk ! the t. v. didn ' t work well , but we manage to find one channel that be stable . we didn ' t mind though because we didn ' t really need the tv , we be there for universal and island of adventure ! ! besides we be so tired when we get back we only have the tv on for 20 minute ( the whole trip ) before turn it off and give in to sleep . last thing- we put the `` do not disturb '' ( or in their case : it say `` quiet please '' ) sign on our door the entire trip . we didn ' t mind our room be messy or reuse towel from the night before . we just didn ' t want anyone to come in our room and steal our stuff or anything . but mysteriously on the second day we have new towel roll up in the place where the old towel be , ( we still have our old towel though where we leave them , there be just also new towel a well ) but our room messiness have remain unchanged . i don ' t think they take anything , but just give u new towel . that be nice but we didn ' t even use them and i believe that they should not have break our privacy if we leave the sign on the door . lastly , check out be perfect . they slip a receipt under your door that you sign and bring to the front desk ( i believe ) ( i forget this part for some strange reason ) , and i get charge a couple day later for the exact price i book on no extra fee or any bullshit . so i be happy to see they be not sneaky about price or anything . overall , great stay . i give it 5 star but really it be a 4 . 5 but i round up because none of the problem be major . i will be stay here again in the future and would recommend it to anyone who want to save money and still get a good hotel .",1,896
"caribbean beach resort be a moderate resort in the epcot resort area . apparently when it be originally design , it be designate a a deluxe resort but disney decide it didn ' t measure up to the other deluxes , so they demote it to a moderate . the resort be a series of complex or `` island '' ( aruba , martinique , etc. ) surround a lake with a big food court/ shopping/ recreation area roughly in the middle . each island have about a half dozen building , all of which be two floor . there be no elevator . the island be nicely do , paint in bright color and theme to look like caribbean villa with lot of greenery and sprawling path . each island have it own pool , `` beach '' ( not for swim ) with hammock and chair , ice machine/ soda machine , park lot , and disney transportation bus stop . our first night , we stay in aruba and have one of the newer find nemo theme room . the room felt updated and fresh , decorate in soft teal with colorful wallpaper and bedspread . there ' s nice little nemo and caribbean- themed touch , like a painting of the disney magic cruise ship on the wall . the room have a split bath , with the toilet and shower in a separate room and then a vanity area with double sink that can be separate with a curtain - very handy for multiple people try to get ready . storage be adequate , with a large dresser , chest , and an open closet . there be a nice tv and table with two chair a well . bf and i have an issue with our room and the front desk end up `` upgrade '' u to a room in trinidad south for the rest of our stay . we have want to stay near our friend in aruba , but no room be available so they give u a pirate room in trinidad south to make u happy . honestly , even though the pirate room be consider deluxe and cost more , i prefer our other room . first , the pirate room be excellently theme with some great attention to detail . the bed be wooden pirate ship with bedspread that look like treasure , the dresser and bench be design to look like crate and a treasure chest , and the refrigerator be even hide in a barrel . despite all of this ( and love potc ) , i be not a fan . because of the decor , the room be very dark and almost dingy feeling . though i love the idea of sleep in a pirate ship , i be always whack myself on the extra wood on the side of bed and footboard . the curtain separate the sink area from the room be a huge skull and crossbones from the potc movie , and to be honest , it kind of creep me out especially when it be backlit from the bathroom lighting . lastly , the room in trinidad south be at the absolute end of the property , so enjoy the long walk to get anywhere and be the last stop on the resort/ disney bus . put it this way : our room be closer to the pop century resort than it be to the caribbean beach resort . if you have a kid who love pirate , then i ' d say go for trinidad south - otherwise , meh . the resort have a large complex call old port royale in the center . there you ' ll find the food court ( b/ l/ d ) , shutter sit- down restaurant ( d ) , a shopping arcade , two pool , and an island- theme play area for the kid . you can also rent bike , paddlewheel boat , and other water toy and take them out on the lake . the biggest negative for this hotel ? the ground be extremely spread out . i can ' t emphasize this enough . i have read plenty of review before come here with people complain about the walk to the food court , etc . but i figure that be just people be fat and lazy and not want to walk a few minute to meal , because , well , people be fat and lazy . wrong ! when a resort have a shuttle system design to take you in between the building , you know they ' re not kid around . it take u about 10min to walk to the food court from aruba , and 15min to walk there from trinidad south . i don ' t mind walking , but at the end of a long day at the park or if you ' re rush to get somewhere , it can be a huge pain . caribbean beach be clean and decent , but i wouldn ' t rush to stay here again . there ' s too many other resort on property , and this one just didn ' t stand out to me .",0,887

"the location of this hotel can ' t be beat . unfortunately , that ' s not enough to save this property . i get a great deal on groupon for this hotel . the front desk clerk be very nice and waive the $ 7 . 99 fee that apparently you be charge when you check in . i also have to sign a paper that say if i smoke in the room , there would be a cleaning fee . i totally appreciate and think that ' s reasonable , so i sign it without question . on the step lead upstairs , there be a cup load with cigarette butt . the property be very dirty and dingy . in the hall , there be broken air conditioner and microwave , just hang out . the place be in need of `` freshen up '' on the outside , but i saw into a room and it look very inviting , so that be a good sign . however , i also saw mattress pile up lean up against a building nearby a i move my car closer to my room . the whole area felt seedy and unsafe . i find my room and a soon a i walk in , i saw a burn mark on the duvet cover . i call downstairs and ask for a duvet replacement a i didn ' t want to be charge that fee . i literally be in the room for 30 second . i didn ' t want to switch room a i have arrive late and have to be somewhere and didn ' t have much time to get there ( this be not my do , the schedule be throw off by logistics beyond my control ) . then , i look around the room and what can i say other than it be very dirty . frame cover the picture have finger print all over the glass . the bathroom mirror look like it hadn ' t be clean . the fixture cover the bathroom lightbulb be dirty . the desk/ table hadn ' t be wipe off . the carpet be stain and filthy . i find crumb and dirt under the desk , a if someone hadn ' t vacuum . i be immediately worried i ' d get bed bug . when the manager arrive , i also point out the sheet corner be not pull over the bed and the mattress pad have slip , leave the mattress expose . the dust ruffle be bunch up and you could see the mattress . i explain i really didn ' t even want to stay in the room at that point , i didn ' t even want to sleep there . he offer to move my room and he do . in all honesty , i didn ' t even want to stay there anymore . i really just want to change for my event and leave , even though it mean drive home at 3am . he say he couldn ' t let me do that because the room be either book or it wasn ' t and that do this would start a long process . frankly , i didn ' t have time to deal with it , so i agree to the room change . he say he ' d personally inspect it . my goodness , the next room wasn ' t much better . there be a terrible smell a soon a i open the door . and , i notice the security bar be break off the door . then , the curtain be open so even `` close , `` someone could still see right in to guest who may be sleep in the bed . the same issue be there with the bed and , i find a large hair on the bathroom tub . the back of the toilet be load with dust . at that point , i just want to change and go , which i do . i load up my car and drive home 3 hour after i get with my event at 3am . i didn ' t feel safe return to that hotel so late and i didn ' t feel secure without the security hinge . i know i wouldn ' t sleep . please do not be lure in by the price and location . the staff be extremely nice , but that ' s about it . the place be a dump and they can ' t change that . let me add that i do ( and have do ) quite a bit of budget traveling and backpacking . i understand this type of travel . but , when something be not clean , it make you wonder what ' s lurking in the room , bed bug , bug , etc . economical traveler deserve standard , too , even if the bar isn ' t that high in the first place .",0,854
"i book this place about a week and a half before come to orlando for only $ 49 per night use priceline . not bad , consider this be bill a a 3 1/ 2 star hotel and it ' s adjacent to the orange county convention center and a slew of restaurant , night life and some shopping . i ' d read some of the previous review of this property , and they seem to be all over the road . in my opinion , this be a solid hotel with good amenity and be worth a 4 star rating on yelp . the room be newly remodel and well appoint with dark wood furniture and headboard , and granite top on the dresser , night stand , a/ c cover and bathroom sink . each room have a refrigerator , a safe , samsung flat screen tv with wireless keyboard for e- mail/ internet access , a coffee maker and rosen ' s own name brand soap , shampoo and lotion . the room all seem to be freshly paint and all the tilework in the bathroom appear to be new a well . it should be note that the entire hotel be non- smoking , include all guest room ( you must sign a contract upon check in , state that you understand and agree to their smoking policy ) . this hotel contain meeting and banquet facility , a bar/ night club that feature a live band on the friday and saturday night of my stay ( i hear the band while dart through the lobby , but never have the chance to check them out myself ) , and a restaurant , an informal bar , a small store and a starbucks in the lobby . they also have a decent gym/ spa facility and offer coin operate laundry machine on several floor . while i be very happy with my stay here overall , especially consider the price i pay , there be a few item that could be improve upon : - there be no wifi access in the hotel room for smartphones or ipads , but there be a cat 5 cable to connect your laptop to the internet . also , unlike many hotel , the rosen do charge for internet access - $ 4 . 99 per hour , $ 10 per day for standard internet or $ 12 . 99 per day for enhanced internet access . sign on to use the internet be a bit cumbersome a well ; rather than see a `` welcome '' screen where one simply use a few mouse click to access the ' net and charge it to your room , you need to enter your name , e- mail address , create a user name and password , etc . etc . before it will allow you to sign on . - while most hotel offer free parking for their guest , here at the rosen plaza they charge $ 8 per day to self- park your vehicle . they also offer valet , i ' m not sure of the rate . - after walk around a trade show floor all day , i be look forward to spend some time in the whirlpool/ hot tub . unfortunately there isn ' t really a decent way to get from the elevator lead up to the hotel room to the pool/ hot tub without walk through the main lobby in full view of everyone at the bar , check- in desk and starbucks ( same be true when go from a guest room to the gym - you must walk through the lobby ) . also , while the hot tub do have a creative and unique waterfall feature flow into it , `` hot tub '' be a stretch . the water be more like lukewarm . - the a/ c in the room be a bit sketchy , and i ' ve see this mention in a few other review here on yelp a well . it be somewhat noisy , didn ' t kick in until the room be excessively warm , and then lower the temperature quite a bit before switch off . it didn ' t really keep the temperature stable . also , when turn the a/ c system on or off use the wall panel , it take several minute to respond . - while the coke machine only charge a very reasonable $ 1 for a can of soda or bottle of water , i find that some be sell out of water but no `` sell out '' indicator light be lit , and the bill acceptor on one of the machine i try be break . - in order to get into my room , i have to insert the key card , then turn the door handle up . if i press the handle down a one normally do , the latch wouldn ' t always open properly .",1,850
"this be a great hotel/ condo ! ! ! i be shock at the previous review . i book a last minute vacation through my timeshare w rci . i call rci up a week ago and tell them i want to go to orlando for a week . they recommend orbit one villa , a 2 bedroom , 2 bathroom suite . i didn ' t need 2 bedroom , but the 2 bedroom be the same price a a 1 bedroom , so i say sure . little do i know that this be exactly what i need for my three year old daughter and myself . the condo/ apartment be huge ! ! ! i be on the third floor where the ceiling be vault , with lot of window ( moon window ) to bring in lot of natural light . bigger than i expect . there be a 6 chaired dining room table , full size kitchen with a complete plate/ silverware for 8 people , and all the appliance you will need for a home feeling . 1 bedroom have 2 twin , and the other a king size bed . the master bath have a huge spa/ jacuzzi tub with stong jet . i love the jacuzzi tub ! ! ! ! big enough for 4 people or more . the living room be equip with a dvd player , and a washer and dryer to clean your clothes at the end of the week . there be no maid service on a daily basis , but i didn ' t need that , nor do i want that . if i need towel , which i didn ' t , i can call for maid service . the pool have two slide , that be my daughter ' s favorite . we spend every day at the pool swim around . there be resort event to participate in throughout the week . nothing serious , but i have fun at karaoke at the pool . i miss out on the ice cream social because i go to disney . this place be really close to disney . 3 mile away at most from magic kingdom and i can not complain . we be there in le than 10 minute . there be no shuttle to get there from the hotel , but i didn ' t have a problem with that since i rent a car for the week . here be the thing . . . if you want to be close to disney , then stay at a disney resort , and pay the disney price ! ! ! ! this place have cheap rate on expedia for what you get versus disney . there should be no complain when you be pay $ 60- 100/ ni for a 2/ 2 that sleep 6 ! ! i mean , what more do you want ? ! also , the guy be write about florida toll road . . . this be florida ! ! ! yes , there be no free road here . : ( everyone have to pay the $ 2 or whatever it be , to leave the airport , and another $ 2 to return . it have nothing to do with which hotel you will be stay at . even if you stay at the disney resort , you will pay the same . breakfast be only donut and muffin until 10a , but it ' s something . internet be only free at the poolside or clubhouse . there be a nice playground for child . there be tennis court and an arcade room for child . the entire complex be well maintain and clean . this place be great ! ! ! there be no granite countertop , or modern feel , but it be very cozy and i like that . this be why i can ' t give it 5- star ! however , i go to visit my gf who be stay at the hilton vacation villa in back of the outlet , and although that place be a lot bigger and more elegant , the inside be small ! ! ! the countertop be granite , but the space be a tiny one bedroom . small small small . the entire place be update though . if i have to choose where to stay , i ' d stay at orbit one villa . the hilton timeshare be about half the size of orbit one , and the location be far from the park , but close to the shop . some more perk : - down the street be super target for your food needs- walking distance , across the street , from mcdonalds and ihop- off the main street 192 , so you can never get lost- lot of stuff to do on 192",1,827
"hammy and i stay here from july 22- 28th for our disney/ universal getaway . we book the 6 night with a roundtrip flight ( new york- orlando ) on orbitz for $ 363 each ! ! ( after this $ 100 promotional coupon we find ) the roundtrip flight would of be about $ 180 each if buy alone but with this package , we basically pay $ 31 each to stay at the point . best decision ever ! the day have not start out very well . the taxi guy drop u off at the wrong place - - pointe orlando which be some shopping plaza vs. the point orlando ( d ' oh ) - - but we call him and he take u to the right place . we get to the point at 12 : 30 but check- in be not until 4pm . we have anticipate this but hop they would let u check- in early so that we would be able to go to animal kingdom and not waste a day . not only do they let u check- in early , they upgrade u to the 1- bedroom suite ! ! ( we have book the junior suite ) the 1- bedroom suite be double the size of the junior ( it be 716 sq foot ! ) , have a full kitchen with all the utensil you ' ll ever/ never need ( coffee maker , silverware , dish , pot , pan , mug , blender , juicer , list go on ) , washer , dryer , glass dining table , sofa bed in living room with flat screen tv . there be another flat screen tv in the bedroom , geez . king- sized bed - - super comfy . lastly ; the bathroom ! ! it be huge ; marbled- floor , jacuzzi tub , seperate huge glass- encase shower ; granite sink countertop . it all felt like our own little apartment , mm . best of all , everything be so clean and look a if it have never be use ( help that the resort be rather new , i guess : ) ) 6 night felt too short of a stay ; we be definitely stay here the next time we be back in the area . other tidbit ; 1. our floor ( wouldn ' t know about the others ) - always quiet ! no disturbance whatsoever ; a if we be the only one on the floor : ) 2. there ' s no restaurant in the hotel ; just a small cafe/ mini bar with variable hour - - wasn ' t a big deal though ; there be plenty of restaurant on international drive which be just a few block from the resort . 3. the shuttle service isn ' t very convenient nor efficient ; no fault of the resort though since it ' s through a travel/ tourism organization that run it . it take u 1 hour to get to universal even though it be just 1 mile away . ( take u $ 6 and 3 min to get back by taxi ! ! ) this be because the shuttle stop at 130958216 hotels/ resort on the way in a ridiculous zig- zag route . our resort be closest to universal and yet we be the first to be pick up = inefficient . same with disney ; of the 2 time we decide to take the shuttle back , it take u 2 hour ! however , no one else seem to mind/ complain/ show visible sign of frustration ; maybe ham and i be just fast- paced people ( we want to get to the park a soon a they open ) ? maybe it ' s the result of living in nyc ? who know ! in the end , we do everything we want to and more with a lot of time to spare so , can ' t complain : ) 4. front desk - super friendly and very helpful when we need toiletry , schedule for shuttle to disney/ universal , help call cab , etc . 5. there be climate control in the room ; don ' t know if it ' s a big deal for others but many of the hotel i ' ve stay at do not have this ( they would often have a dial where you specify warmer or cooler but cmon ! that ' s a little subjective , yes . . . ? ) ; i love sleep in freeze temperature , hammy too ; set it at 66 + have the ceiling fan on ; it be great , hha . overall - - excellent ! !",1,809
"over the last few year i think disney think they ' ve improve on some thing and really have fail on many more . after make a package reservation where they make u feel like everything be take care of and upon arrival to the airport we ask about our magic express transportation that be suppose to be arrange , it wasn ' t , they have to see if they could fit u in , which be funny because the bus be half empty when we finally call the magical express , get our name on the list get to the counter which be only in one terminal , a long walk or even ride from the other at orlando airport . when we get there there be a lot of stand and wait . if you be think about use this benefit , i ' d consider the $ 70 to take a taxi to your hotel . notice the hotel not resort . you can ' t call a motel 6 room without hot water much of the day , with le tv channel and dorm comfort bed a resort . the bell service be good , but whenever you ask everyone a question no one know the answer . in 5 day i know more about thing at the resort then the worker do , include the front desk . we stay at the port orleans french quarter ( resort ? ) the bell service with luggage to the room be good but if you need a ride anywhere on this immense property they would reluctantly take you , but in a nice disneyish way. `` i ' d be more than happy to take you but most people walk , it ' s really not that far '' . it be like play the lottery see if the hot water would come on . great wifi , but not 1 printer , pc or anything relate to a business center where you could print something out , or maybe this be a case of the front desk not know . the food at the hotel consist of 1 cafeteria style place with 4 different type of food . this place crack me up a little . there could be chicken nugget and fry under a heat lamp and 3 employee behind the counter and i ' m the only person in the place and they would say that will be 5- 10 minute and hand me a buzzer . i ' d look around at an empty room feeling like ben stiller in meet the parent at the airport . i ask do you need to cook some fresh one and another employee with a smile would say just give u 5 minute . so i ' d look around at some offering , glance back at my still empty counter stroll by slowly , get my ketchup and napkin and my drink that you can only refill every 5 minute ( even though the manager say i must have a hacked cup because most of the cup allow you to get a refill every 2 minute ) seriously ! ! ! so a soon a i sit down the buzzer go off . guess what cold fry and nugget on a plate . wow . positive , nice laundry room and gift shop price weren ' t bad , pool be nice for little kid , didn ' t go over 4 ft deep . when visit the park you would spend much more time in line than anything else . at least 50 % of the thing we want to see or do at any of the 3 park we visit be either close for repair or have technical difficulty . the only sure fire bet be restaurant and gift shop . if i want to shop i wouldn ' t have go to disney . the magic band be a disappointment . ours never work properly which translate into just more time wait in more line troubleshoot problem to get through our visit . supervisor after supervisor be call , and you have to wait for them to arrive . they blame it on me use a different finger for my fingerprint scan , the weather , the fastpass system not work properly . the entire trip i felt like i be on the phone solve a simple issue with dish network . what would ' ve take an impersonable 10 min phone call to my cable company turn into a 2 hr phone call fill with thank you sir , yes sir , have a magical day sir . i felt like many needle wait due to their poor system and unneeded sophistication .",0,803
"i book this hotel back in may a a spur of the moment decision to meet family member in orlando . i have stay at the pop century resort before and love it . the all star resort be slightly cheaper than the animation and pop century resort , so i pick the music resort because they have the family suit . the suite be sell out , but i go ahead and book a regular room anyway because of the value . i request a crib and later call back & amp ; request a refrigerator . be tell the fridge be now standard in every room . also call the disney florist to have a special gift deliver for our grandson to the resort room on the day of our arrival . everyone i speak to be very friendly & amp ; helpful , a this would be our wed anniversary and our grandson ' s first visit . the rep even suggest pin display our celebration wait on our arrival . and while the pin be there , they be not decorated/ display our name like others i saw . find the resort easily , check in be very easy . we be in bldg 5 on the 3rd floor . no problem with park . be surprise there be no luggage cart to move luggage to your room . so it take two trip to unpack the car . room be clean . air conditioner work great , especially for august . however , there be no crib a promise , but we have bring the pack & amp ; play for the overnight stay on the drive down . the pack & amp ; play fit perfectly by the bathroom vanity , and the pull curtain for the bathroom really help put our grandson down at night . the room do have a fridge , but a note on the front state they have to unplug all their unit due to some problem . we receive several message , welcome u to the resort , wish u a happy anniversary , ask if we have any problem with check in . i think we end up with a total of six message . the gift for our grandson arrive shortly after arrival and be leave on the bed a promise . we do request a phillips screwdriver from maintenance to change the battery in a toy , and they never show up . so we go down to them and change them there . housekeep keep the room clean & amp ; provide everything we ask for . it do rain heavily one day and the stairwell at the end of bldg 5 be very wet , and i do slip and fall ( luckily on the bottom step ) despite have good tread sneaker on . while we do not swim , we do walk around the main pool area and it seem very nice . only vend machine be soda and ice of course . would have be nice to have a snack machine . there be a small shop off the lobby to buy souvenir . i do not walk all the way through it . i do find the food court very disappointing . the one at the pop century be great when i stay there . this one be no where near close . it seem like le choice . when i walk up to order ( i be the only one in line ) the woman server say `` you want something '' in kind of a rude tone . the alfredo sauce be very watery and the salad be wilt and have some kind of brownish red dressing on it . i throw that out immediately . there be lot of dirty table , floor be dirty , the high chair need wipe down . needle to say , we do not go back . but that be one of the perk of stay on disney property , you can actually visit any of the resort to eat . which we plan on do , but never get to . it be relatively quiet . i could hear toilet be flush in other room . the only voice i could hear be on the walkway outside . we receive another message from the manager thank u for our stay . when we call to request a very early checkout , they assure u there be no need to come to the lobby , to leave when we need to , and again ask how our stay be . all in all , we be happy with the resort and would go back .",1,795
"a i sit and read some of the snarky , rude and even bizarre complaints/ comment , while sit in this very hotel , in my room ( day 4 of 6 ) . . . at the clarion inn lbv , i be have a little laugh and thinking , what have some people be smoke and what in the world be some people expectation ? let be honest here , this be not the ritz , or some luxury spa and resort in palm beach where people be at your beck and call , rather this be a really nice value brand hotel , that be at , or very near the top of it class for what it be . to the overly critical negative nancy ' s of the world , do everyone a favor and stay home ! this be a hotel that be situate really close to disney , in fact you be about a 1/ 4 mile from the disney property and right off the highway with many amenity nearby , such a restaurant , store , entertainment etc . which really be a plus when stay here . the hotel itself have many offering such a a couple pool , a bar , and restaurant on the property , which be really convenient , a well a a in room fridge and microwave . they do have free shuttle , but i have a car so this be not something i can speak on other than to say that it another plus . about housekeeping and the people who seem to dislike them , this hotel have over 600 room that they need to maintain and have ready for the next guest arrive , so sorry your personal zone of isolation be disturb while they try to stay on top of thing . . . perhaps the `` do not disturb '' placard should have be place on the door , duhh ! no one ever bother me , no one pound on or even open my door . . . in fact they wouldn ' t even open the room for me when i close the door with my key on the dresser , she explain that if their badge be use to enter the room , it be track and she could be in trouble , she even call security to ask for permission to let u ( or her ) in to retrieve the key- card , but we be tell we need to get another key at the desk where they could verify who we be . sound like a policy that be work ! i have read some complain about the noise of the highway , uhh . . . this hotel be situate next to the highway , so yeah you ' re gon na hear highway noise . all the room have outside door , half face the non highway side , and the other half do . . . so it stand to reason that if on that side , you be go to hear the traffic of i- 4. the thing be , it be a constant noise of traffic and basically wind up be white noise , similar to a bathroom exhaust fan . if i didn ' t care for it , i be sure they would have move me if they have the availability , but a it be there be no big deal , and i find it soothe to a certain degree . this hotel be the least expensive in it class , and about a third cheaper than the next closest large hotel , and rat higher on all the other travel site review section , which make me think that `` some '' in the yelp sphere be overly critical and tend to be glass half empty type of folk . likely the same who would give the magic kingdom and mickey mouse himself low mark , for not accommodate them better . bottom line here here , this be a great value hotel for a good price , that offer many freebie , amenity , and convenience that earn this high mark . it a secure property with a 24 guard who will not let people on the property that do not have business here , so no parking pas then no entry . the hotel ( room , pool & amp ; common area ) be clean , comfortable and welcome . . . and a mention there be no bug . i would have no problem come back here .",1,777
"i want to share something with you all that may prove to be useful one day - if you ever travel and stay in hotel . in july i travel to orlando to participate in an event i sponsor there . the event be hold at the international palm resort on international drive , orlando - a hotel very popular with family because of it close proximity to all of the theme park . during my stay i continually place the do not enter sign on my door a i have have personal item steal before by clean staff at hotel . despite this - staff continually enter my room without knock and at odd time of the day ( no cleaning require so not sure what they be look for ) . on the last day of my stay i pack my belonging , leave out my toothbrush , lipstick , my watch , necklace and a dress for the day and shoe . twenty minute later i return to find my door jar open , a man with a clean cart at the door with an arm full of sheet . he have enter my room , saw my personal belonging , strip the room anyhow and be on his out of the room when i catch him . i give him a mouthful about enter my room a the do not enter sign be still on the door . after change into my clothes and do my teeth i go to put on my watch and necklace - and find the necklace go . i be talk about a 30 inch 18 carat ( australian gold be different ) heavy chain with a solid gold 3 dimensional heart with 32 diamond on it . value at $ 5000 more than ten year ago . more importantly - my child give it to me . i immediately accost the man again - but he couldn ' t speak english . three month down the track - i have make 78 phone call to that hotel - and have only one return . i be tell not to file a police report at the hotel like to handle thing in house . today i be tell by the insurance company that the hotel say that i have file no police report so must be lie about the theft - of course i file a police report ! ! ! i be tell by the insurance agency not to call the hotel anymore , that they be deny my claim because `` sometimes thing just disappear '' . . . . . my dear - gold do not just disappear . . . . . . i be also tell by the hotel insurance agency that i sign an agreement when i sign into the hotel - agree that they be not responsible for any loss unless i log everything in when i check in . that mean - if you have an iphone , ipad , computer , wed ring - cash - anything that get steal from your room - unless you have give a full list of those item when you check into a hotel in florida ( also many other state ) and the girl on the desk who be usually rude a she have 20 other people behind you try to check in - unless she sign a statement say that you have those belonging with you - then you can not hold the hotel responsible when their cleaning staff steal your belonging . it take me two month to get a copy of that paper that i sign when i check in and it say no such thing ! so now they be resort to the florida inkeepers law - which state that - if the hotel clean staff who enter your room every day - who at this hotel be not check for criminal history at the employment stage - if they rob you blind - you can only sue the hotel for $ 500. to get that $ 500 be like get blood from a stone - they will run you in circle , ignore every call and then tell you you be deny because `` sometimes thing just disappear '' . so next time you book into any hotel - ask them - what be their policy for steal property from your room ? it could save you a lot of heartache . and always watch what you sign when you check in . . . .",0,766
"this hotel have an average rating of 3 star , and that ' s about right imo . this be an older hotel for certain , though they ' ve do a decent job of keep her updated and everything from the bathroom fixture and furnishing to the light fixture , bed and hardware in the room be newer . they could do a better job of keep up on maintenance , however ; there be stain on the wall near the entrance door , the round table that serve a a night stand between the two bed be heavily chip in place and the power outlet that be mount in the desk be loose and come apart . there be also a large area on the mirror in the bathroom where it appear the reflective surface behind the glass be chip away . tv selection be meh , they have all the larger network and hbo , but it wasn ' t a good a some other hotel i ' ve be in lately . i appreciate the alarm clock next to the bed for it simplicity ; there ' s 1 button to set the alarm , an up/ down button to adjust the alarm time , and a button to turn the alarm on . that ' s it ! no extra feature like a radio or ipod dock station or music and sound effect to lull you to sleep , etc . just a simple , straightforward alarm clock . the room also have a safe , hair dryer , boutique lotion , soap and shampoo , and a 1 or 2 cup coffee maker with a selection of regular and decaf coffee and tea . wifi be complimentary - i use it on 2 evening and early morning and the speed be more than adequate . it should be note that the connected parking garage be really the only parking option for this hotel . it ' s $ 17/ night to park there and the garage be not accessible from the interior of this hotel . one must take the elevator to the lobby , schlep through the lobby , go outside the main entrance and down a breezeway into the adjacent garage before reach the ( slow and dirty ) elevator which will take you to the floor where you ' ve park . while the location of this hotel be decent , right off i- 4 , there ' s really nothing within walk distance to do/ see at night , so unless you ' re happy with the restaurant/ bar at this property , you ' re go to be stick drive or call a cab or share ride service to find better option for food or drinkwhen i first walk into my room at this hotel , i immediately notice a set of earplug on the night stand , with a note say that this area be convert to a different type of rail system soon , but until then , they hop the earplug they ' d provide would make my stay a better one . translation : there ' s a friggin ' locomotive with a loud set of air horn that rumble past this hotel at all hour . nice ! though i wasn ' t bother by the train or traffic noise that can be hear from nearby i- 4 , i be surprise at how much sound from outside be audible in my room . maybe instead of place ear plug in all the room , they could simply caulk and seal the window ? on the first night i stay here , there be no `` do not disturb '' sign in my room . i think perhaps when one bolt the door , this somehow indicate to the staff that the room be occupy . nope ! housekeeping start knock at just after 8 : 30 a. m. when i explain i wasn ' t planning to leave until 10 , that be merely a `` snooze button '' for them , and they start knock again 45 minute later . oddly , room service never place a do not disturb sign in my room for the second night of my stay , i have to get my own from the front desk . the $ 257 include tax per night that i pay for my stay here be absolutely not worth it . if i ' d pay about 1/ 2 that rate , then maybe .",1,765
"we have be spoil by stay at disney ' s beach club and boardwalk resort . these resort be wrap around crescent lake , adjacent to epcot . we find ourselves with the opportunity to spend 3 night at the yacht club , and jump at the opportunity , a we ' ve always want to try it there . building and ground : beautiful , stately building , reminiscent of martha ' s vineyard resort of the early 1900 ' s. don ' t miss the pool . . . it ' s just awesome . location & amp ; transportation : not a super a beach club or boardwalk , but pretty darn terrific . walk to epcot in about 8 minute . . . walk to the studio or take a boat . . . both will take about 15 min . bus service to mk and ak be more than fine . yacht club be pick up before beach club . room and view : here ' s where it falter a bit . i felt like the room hit you over the head with the nautical theme . it felt more kitschy than at boardwalk and beach club . in addition , there be 2 light bulb out when we get to the room , and the closet door be completely off it hinge . bed be comfortable and pillow be fantastic . wifi work better than at previous disney stay . i can ' t complain about the view at all . it be lovely , and although we be never in the room at this time , illumination at epcot could have be view . lobby : love it . stately , elegant , and quiet . compare to it neighboring resort , it be an oasis of calm . it also smell like heaven . food option : we din at captain ' s grill , and it be fine , nothing remarkable , but fine . it fare better for breakfast than for dinner . i can ' t say enough about the ale and compass lounge . it be our post- park oasis of gentlemanly- ness . denise be a particularly friendly bartender here . cast member : i find the lobby greeter , the bellboy , the concierge , and the food staff to be delightful . i can ' t say the same for the check- in desk and the mousekeeping staff . at check- in , the lady help me have a strong accent , and mumble , make it very difficult to understand her and on top of this , she let me stand there for several minute on end , look confuse and not say anything . i ' d love to have be filled- in on what be go on . eventually , i be send to a room that have 2 maintenance people , who tell me the room be out of circulation . i call the front desk and they tell me i have to come back down , so i do . they then tell me that my room wouldn ' t be ready for a while , and they ' d call me when it be . . . . they never do . a for mousekeeping , i call and ask for turndown service twice per day , for each of our 3 day , and only once do it happen . i will say though . . the room be immaculate at all time . in summation , a i read this review , it doesn ' t seem like i have a bad experience at the yacht club , and the truth be . . . . i didn ' t ! it ' s a lovely resort , and i ' d stay there again , but when compare to it ' s neighbor , the beach club and the boardwalk , it ' s just subpar . i ' d reccomend the yacht club for couple travel without child , a it be very kid- friendly , but didn ' t seem to have a plethora of child race around the lobby . i also find the yacht club to me more formal/ elegant than it ' s neighbor , so if that ' s your thing , go for it . in the future , i ' ll seek out the more casual elegance of the beach club and boardwalk .",1,757
"on friday august 27 , 2014 before make a night reservation for saturday august 27 , 2014 i call this day inn and speak to the general manager by the name of aj also know a anshu jain about the concern i have in reference to lot of negative and low star review of his establishment . anshu jain assure me that he stand by the brand name ( day inn ) and also assure me that his establishment be clean and i win ' t be disappointment . he do mention to me that there be construction go around his hotel during weekday but i do not see any construction work at all . this be the excuse inexpensive hotel generally use . i want to be very close to universal studio and there be only three non- universal studio hotel locate very near universal studio ( the hyatt place , doubletree by hilton and holiday inn & amp ; suite ) and the room be all sell out due to long labor day weekend , i have no choice but to book a room for one night stay through american airline website . i arrive at day inn around 4 : 30 pm ( check in time be 4 : 00 pm ) most hotel around the area have check- in at 3 : 00pm . i wait in line for about twenty ( 20 ) minute ) for check- in because they only have one person work the reservation check - in desk . the check- in clerk tell me that the hotel charge a mandatory fee of $ 2 . 25 for room safe and my credit card would be charge $ 5 . 00. i inform the reservation clerk that i be not carry $ 1000 or $ 5000 or even $ 10 , 000 with me so i do not need the safe . but they still charge me and i can get it credit through my credit card company . remember this be not a resort fee but a hidden undisclosed fee relate to the use of their room safe ( see picture ) . when i enter the room , it smell musty . i notice that there be no carpet on the floor , the room floor be tile , no coffee maker or coffee , no hair dryer . the bed mattress be of very inferior quality . when you sit on the bed or even lay down it seem that you be suck in and bounce . just like a vehicle when it need shock absorber . their furniture in this hotel ( see picture ) be either crack or break . may be this hotel purchase the furniture from a flee- market or from salvation army or even a good - will store . when i enter the bathroom , the tub floor be uneven and you can feel it when you take the shower . yes ! ! i do found couple of small live roach in my room and very small bug that you can see it with the help of magnify glass on the room table and on the floor . they have a free wifi . this be the room where anshu jain assure me be their good room . the pool area be clean but their so- call tiki bar be close , especially on a labor ' s day weekend . i be inform that the hotel lobby door close at 10 : 00 pm because of hotel robbery and they use a small- secure box mount to the wall for very late check- in for hotel key purpose . when i check , none of the three hotel that i have mention above close their lobby . this hotel need a lot of renovation and landscape work . if the worst come to worst and there be no place to stay in a clean and safe hotel , i would not pay more than $ 29 . 99 for the stay . they have an indian restaurant attach to the hotel know a tabla , which serve breakfast , lunch buffet and dinner . food be okay but there be other fine restaurant on international drive . there be no store , restaurant or even drug store such a cv or walgreen at walk distance . except tabla restaurant and their in- house good for nothing store .",0,747
"i stay at this hotel 4/ 1- 4/ 4/ 16. my sister reserve the room for my husband and i so that our room could be next to each other . when i arrive ( a few day after my sister ; she be attend a conference ) i explain that we be pay for our own room , give them my credit card and reward number for marriott and discuss the pricing at $ 139/ night for the double bed standard room . upon checkout at 1200 , the pricing on the bill be $ 199/ night plus tax . i ask again why be a higher price give and not the advertised price of $ 139/ night . renee , the front desk staff say that be the conference pricing and try to change the pricing on the computer because we be not part of the conference and when she could not do it she tell me that she would get back to be in a `` little bit '' with an answer . i give her my phone number and email . at 1900 that night , i have not hear from her and call the hotel . i be then put in contact with the front desk manager , michael matthew who be incredibly unprofessional . he refuse to listen to the situation and tell me that he would have to contact renee the next day when she arrive to work and ask what she tell me and if in fact she say that she would change the pricing , she would be in `` trouble for that. `` at 1300 the next day , michael leave a message on my phone say that the room be book under a conference rate and not a standard rate and there be no way for the pricing to be change and he say that renee never say that she would check into the pricing . i be sure she do not admit to this if he be go to reprimand her for help me the day before . he refuse to listen to my reason the day before and understand that i have nothing to do with the conference . also why would the conference pricing be more than the pricing list on their website . sound like a way to screw over guest that be attend conference there . in addition , this hotel charge a `` resort fee '' for $ 25/ day for thing like transportation to disney ( at very set time that be not flexible ) , breakfast for kid under 12 for free , `` high '' speed internet . this be a complete joke ! the high speed internet be the slowest that i have see in a long time ( like dial up ) . we do not have child under 12. therefore , the resort fee be a completely not worth it . you can get an uber for $ 8- 10 to the disney park . we want to go swimming in the pool . it start sprinkle rain and they blow the horn require everyone to get out . there be no inclement weather like thunder or lightening and the pool be close until the sun be completely out later in the day . although the buffet breakfast be quite extensive with many option , it be $ 24/ pp . that be a ludicrous price for hotel breakfast . i would highly recommend that no one book a conference here or a personal stay for that matter . there be disney hotel with much better benefit , customer service , and fair pricing , not to mention free transportation . i plan conference for a major healthcare association and we will never book or a here or at a marriott after find out that they be completely unfair with their conference member pricing . the management , specifically michael should have listen to the customer concern and come to a middle ground consider i have nothing to do with the conference . he be unprofessional in his demeanor by telephone and the way that he handle this situation . i will most likely also never stay in another marriott again . i be a loyal customer for many year , but there be many other hotel to choose from when you travel .",0,737
"the magic kingdom have really lose it luster when it come to be customer driven . i be here for a week long conference and very underwhelmed . sure , the disney boardwalk be pretty with the boat and water , and all the backdrop that florida have to offer , but behind this facade , i experience a lack of customer service and no customer driven attitude . upon check in , the hotel take my entire amount for my stay off of my credit card in advance . this should have be a tell tale sign . it tell me that if i be unhappy with my stay , and want to move elsewhere , i be out of luck , since they already have my money . they have not correctly capture my reservation and it take 15 minute to correct it at after midnight ( sigh ) . head up to the room , the elevator button you have to push multiple time just to call the elevator . for the amount of money we be spend on room , you would think they could repair the button . i experience this every day . the room , upon first appearance be spacious and nice enough , but it be lack some of the essential , which i have to call 2x about to have deliver to my room - luggage rack , soap , hanger , shampoo , adequate pillow , etc . they tout be earth friendly and not want to waste water by leave a bag only one of the day for recyclable item and not change the bed except 1 out of four day , yet my shower waste a great deal of water , a much of it escape from the tub spigot . it be in need of repair . i wake up one morning with multiple bite on my mid section , knee and ankle . i mention to the management that there might be bed bug or spider . when i come back late in the evening , they say they find nothing in my room . when i ask how they explain the bite , they say i could go to the hospital to get them check out , but there be no bug in my room . that even , i find a large bug crawl on the bed . i catch it , and call the front desk to send a manager up . no one ever come . the next morning ( my last day there ) , i have to insist someone come up and look at it . they do , and say they would find out what it be . return to my room in the afternoon , it be apparently not a biting bug . they still could not explain the bite . they be apologetic at the end of the stay , but never offer anything to make up for it . . . a discount , a meal in the restaurant , any compensation . why should they ? they already have my money . upon leave , i try to book a spot on the airport shuttle , but they be already book . i try to check my bag on to the airport , but they have already leave . actually , that part , i be glad i do not do . when take a cab to the airport , the bell stand accidentally load a carry on bag from another customer that be not in our cab . since we notice it at the airport , and figure it be likely a colleague , we take the initiative to ensure it get back to it owner . i know mistake happen , but the bell stand do not even ensure they be load our bag and people check their bag assume they be secure . while the property be appeal to look at , don ' t look to closely or peel back the layer , because it be not really that magical . the service be lack luster and haphazard . they do have friendly disney property staff that smile , wave at you and welcome you to the magic kingdom . just don ' t ask for help , because the customer service magically disappear .",0,734
"we just return from a week in orlando at the cabana bay beach resort and have a great time . the retro look and feel be pretty cool and it be the best value for the money in the area . pros- the hotel be clean and have a lot to do with two different pool ( one with a lazy river and another with a waterslide ) , on premise gym , bowl alley , arcade , multiple fire pit , and movie each night by the pool . we admittedly didn ' t take advantage of most of these a we spend some pretty long day in the park and just want to crash at night . - the shuttle run every 10 minute from 7am- 2am to universal . we never have to wait for a shuttle and even leave the park with thousand of other people they always have 2- 3 shuttle line up ready to take you back to the hotel ( which be only a 5- minute shuttle ride away or about a 1 . 5 mile walk ) . - with your room key you get early admission to universal an hour before the park open to the public . this allow u to go on some of the more popular ride with virtually no wait include the minion ride and diagon alley a well a take the train to island of adventure right when it open ( the train ride itself be a cool experience - you need to try it in both direction ) . - staff be friendly and accommodate and there be a universal desk on premise- the price be le than half of the `` on premise ' hotel which be a great value for the week . our room even have a kitchenette which have a fridge and microwave so we could keep a host of snack there . it be also pretty convenient to other location on international drive ( which be a $ 6 uber ride away ) . cons- hotel do not include the express pas which the on- property hotel include . that alone can cover the price difference in the hotel which would be worth it for shorter visit or during peak vacation week . luckily nh school vacation be an `` off '' week and we rarely have to wait in any line for ride at the park even without the pas . we stay for 5 night and only go to universal for 3 day , so it didn ' t make sense to spend the extra money on the other hotel . - limited dining option . there be a `` diner '' which have a decent variety of food and a starbucks . you can also get food out by the pool ( limited menu ) . no room service unless you want to order pizza ( we generally have multiple take- out menu shove under our door daily ) - if you want to use a tube for the lazy river , you need to buy one ( $ 6 for the `` cheap '' one ) . i understand the park charge for everything , but this seem kind of like `` nickel and dim '' you . i could even get past the $ 18 sunblock in the gift shop , but for some reason pay $ 12 for two tube bother me ( though i probably spend that for a single ice cream at the park ) . - hotel be not optimally lay out . our room be fairly convenient , but the hotel be huge so you could perceivably get a room that be a good distance away from the shuttle bus with no real `` shortcut '' to get there . overall we would stay there again in a heartbeat a our family suite come to just over $ 150/ night . if you be go during a `` peak '' time with a family of 4+ , you may want to consider stay on one of the universal property that include the express pas with the room ( the express pas for a family of 4 come out to nearly $ 300/ day alone ) . if you go on an off week , we find it wasn ' t need .",1,732
"most of my family and i stay here this past weekend ( overnight on both 4/ 27 and 4/ 28 ) a most of them be in town for my sister ' s wedding on 4/ 28. since i live here in orlando , of course i normally would not stay at a hotel in the area unless i absolutely have to , but my parent want a much of the family a possible to stay in the hotel , particularly on the night of 4/ 28 , so that the majority of u could have breakfast in the hotel ' s lobby the following morning before many relative return to their respective city that afternoon . i didn ' t spend a whole lot of time here , so my review probably win ' t be a detail- orient a many of the exist others . after the rehearsal dinner on fri. night , some of my relative and i come to the hotel and hung out at the bar adjacent to the lobby for the majority of the remainder of the evening . we have a really nice time and i be impress by the bartender , who somehow be able to keep all of our drink fill on her own and while have to deal with perhaps 5 or so other party , all of which have at least several people . i don ' t know how much the drink cost since one of my cousin , who i believe make a substantial amount of money , pay for all of the party ' s beverage . the lobby , itself , be nice . there be adequate seat throughout it , with the majority of the seat be close to the breakfast buffet . some comfortable furniture rest beyond the bar area and be accompany by a tv . i sit there for only a few minute on fri. night a my cousin and i try to find the coyotes/ predator nhl playoff game to watch , but the hotel ' s tv do not offer that channel . ( too bad , ' cause it look like we miss a pretty good game. ) i have a room to myself for saturday night and find it to be pretty nice . i get in late on saturday night ( there be a lot of post- wedding drunkenness . . . i probably get to my room sometime between 3- 4 a. m. ) and head straight to my bed , so i didn ' t get to experience much of what the room offer . when i wake up on sunday , i quickly get in the shower and , after that , get dress and go downstairs to meet the family at maybe between 10- 10 : 30 a. m. so . . . i wasn ' t in the room for very long and really wasn ' t sober or awake enough to take in many detail . it seem pretty nice , though . i ' m unsure how much it cost since my parent take care of that . i do remember it have a nice view , though my room be off to the side . other room likely have even better view . ( room toward the back of the hotel likely have view overlook lake eola. ) i didn ' t interact with the staff all that much , though when i do i find them to be very friendly . everything seem clean and in order throughout the hotel . there be some minor issue on sunday morning ( one of the elevator wasn ' t working , so there be large crowd gather around in the lobby and near the one that do work ) , but other than that the stay go off without a hitch . i would stay here again if i have to . i also find this to be very convenient to the downtown area , which relatives and i walk to on both fri. and sat . night and with ease . i forget how close it be to there and be pleasantly surprise when the walk home on both fri. and sat . night and while slightly inebriate be relatively stress- and incident- free .",1,727
"be an annual pas holder , i probably should have opt to stay in one of the actual disney property . i ' d rather have pay a little more for a better , more courteous experience - - especially to celebrate an anniversary . the experience start off on a bad note when one of the valet member ( name mac or matt ? , apparently he be one of the valet manager ) answer my question like i be a nuisance . i plan to do self- parking but need to park my car close to the entrance so i can check in . other car be park on the curb to check in , but i think it be decent to ask first . in a nonchalant tone , he say no and that it be a fire lane . he be not courteous at all . after say no , he walk away . after drive many hour to reach orlando , it be not pleasant to start our vacation this way . upon pass , many staff member in the lobby and ground never seem to greet and seem to be either busy or in a bad mood . however , housekeep always greet u with a smile . the only other courteous encounter we ' ve experience be upon check- in with ambar and valet with phil . they have the courtesy we expect from an apparent 4- star hotel . we be give a complimentary voucher for a 30- minute paddle boat ride . we ' ve check in and walk over to the resort area . we notice that the paddle boat hour be from 11am to 4pm . it be only 3 : 08pm when we arrive at the area where we can rent the paddle boat . there be two staff member there and we politely ask if we can rent the paddle boat . both of the staff member state they be closed and chuckle to each other . the weather that day be perfect and we figure it be a perfect time to do the paddle boat since we would be busy at the park the following day . we would have no other time to experience this . another bad experience with the staff member . keep an open mind , we decide not to fret and waste time about this on our vacation . the resort fee of $ 25/ night include in- room wifi internet . the wifi be not work and i spent about half an hour with their tech support try to get our phone and ipads connect . i have no idea about the $ 18/ night self- parking , which i be bum about because i can park for free at the park since i be an annual pas holder . it could not be waive because it be technically not a disney- owned hotel . the room be standard but we have a view of hollywood studio and could see the firework at night . the bathroom seem renovate with new faucet and shower . however , brown water come out at first when we first start the shower . after run the water a little while , the water clear . we probably should have notify the front desk but the problem never occur again . housekeeping be vey respectful with the do- not- disturb sign . it be nice to see they ' ve leave a replenishment of water bottle and coffee on our door handle . the location be convenient with a short walk to the boardwalk and epcot . the water taxi have a quick turnover time for transport to epcot and hollywood studio . i be tell a new water taxi come every twenty minute or so . the bus shuttle to magic kingdom be also convenient . overall , the experience be close to be abysmal . i recommend this hotel if you can find it cheaper from a 3rd party bidding site and not have high expectation . if you ' re planning to go on an outting and celebrate a special occasion at disney , dish out a little more money and stay on one of the actual property own by walt disney world .",0,723
"after read review i come here expect the worst but be draw to the location and price . i stay for 3 night and i think this place be decent and have everything i need for such a low price . when i arrive the man at the front desk be nice and friendly and check in be a breeze . the room card be old school punch style which i ' ve never see before so that be neat/ retro . i ask for a room higher up since i didn ' t want to be so close to the pool and the worst review i read be mainly on the first floor . i stay in room 340. have a view of the tree since we be on the backside/ parking lot side . the elevator be slow , take the stair most of the time and that wasn ' t so bad since there ' s no gym to work out in anyway . the room be adequately clean . i do not see any bug . there be rug flooring that be a little skeevy but i just wear my flip flop . the mini fridge look newer and work well . the tv be very old and boxy but it work fine . the safe be gross and rusty but if you ' re stay here why would you be leave anything of value in the room anyway . the bathroom be not the nicest but i didn ' t see any mold and it be clean and the water be hot . towel be thin and scratchy but they be clean and replace everyday so that be fine . one of our light be out but all the others work . i pick a room with two queen so that we could have option on pick the better bed . we move all the pillow to one bed so that we have 4 total . some of the pillow be lumpy or flat so it work out have double . the outer comforter cover and blanket we rip off the bed and we didn ' t use bc most place don ' t wash those . the sheet be clean and one set be newer than the other so we use that . since we stay in december the weather be kinda cool and we do not need the ac at all . turn on the heat one night when it get chilly and it work pretty well although it be quite loud . noise from the highway do travel a bit but it ' s like white noise so it didn ' t bother me . the location of this place be great . it be so easy to walk to universal from there about 20 min so we save on parking . the walk be also well light up at night and there be a security camera in the front of the hotel . there be a walgreens right there and a kfc and a few other place to eat or buy souvenir on international drive . we make a trip to the publix which be a grocery store about 10 min away by car to pick up snack , fruit , juice , and cup o noodle . there ' s a microwave on the first floor near the pool that guest can use . vend machine and laundry machine that you have to pay for be in there too . the pool be warm and look ok although i didn ' t get a chance to go in . they have a cafe that open up in the morning with really limited item . coffee there be cheap but also disgust . no wifi in room but i didn ' t need it anyway since we be out most of the day . there be wifi in the lobby . it ' s an older place in a good location . you get what you pay for so be prepared and ask for a room higher up or switch room if you ' re not happy with the first . it have everything that i need to be comfortable . the staff seem pretty accommodate and everyone i meet be friendly .",0,722
"this review be for their banquet and catering at the lm westin in june , 2012. we have a two- day meeting here a year ago , with dinner and reception , a well a lunch etc . ; while i don ' t recall there be anything extraordinarily , i don ' t remember have any issue either . ff to a year later , at the scps sup bill vogel retirement gala 2 week ago , and thing have fall apart a bit . the circulate apps be mixed : fried shrimp thing border on ' horrid ' , but others be fine . come dinner time , though , there be 3 item on the entree and two thing wrong with it : first . let ' s start with a `` risotto '' q & amp ; a : question : how do you make risotto properly for a couple of hundred people ? answer : you don ' t. it taste like it be butter up to feign creaminess , and either deliberately undercooked , or mixed with a quantity of undercooked grain , to affect the texture : al dente shouldn ' t mean `` stick to your teeth '' . talk about which . . . ( see * below , a i be about to digress ) . in any case , it taste ersatz ; i don ' t know about you , but i don ' t take ' fake ' kindly . now when they fake you out twice on one plate , it ' s time to report the crime . what i mean be , the corvina ( my new- find fave fish that ' s relatively reasonable in price and environmentally responsible , at least the last i look ) - the so- call `` grilled '' corvina , be fake too ! sure , you can see the grill mark , but bite into it , and you ' ll know that they be a product of hybrid cooking method . it be either steam first , or poach first , but a couple of bite in , and that become abundantly clear . i have so little faith by then i be about to pull out a csi- type kit to see if the grilled mark be real , or just paint on . i take comfort in think it be probably more healthful than grill from begin to end , but more tasty it be not . ah well , at least the veggie be decent , and i didn ' t hear any complaint from red- meat lover who choose the filet over the corvina . service be spotty : they seem disorganize , miss our entire table for coffee until we beg for some joe 10 minute after every other table ' s have their refill . on a positive note , dessert be good , and the coffee be worth wait for . * talk about al dente , you may not know this if you ' re not chinese , but we have an `` al dente '' concept too , that applies to some , but not all noodle ( rice noodle , for instance , aren ' t suppose to be cook al dente ) . heck , the concept probably travel with the noodle and rice when marco bring them to the western world . so when you eat at a genuine won- ton noodle restaurant in hong kong or southern china , you judge the 3 component almost equally : it ' s not just how good be the won- ton ( most important ingredient be the little bit of smoked fish they put in to flavor it ) or how good the broth be , but also the quality of the noodle . good noodle can ' t be soggy or over- cooked - the term for it be `` daan nga '' , with the first word meaning `` spring '' ( a in `` bouncy bouncy '' ) and the second word , ' teeth ' . in other word , good noodle need to be cook , but still bounce off your teeth . chew on that , foodie .",0,719
"whether you have fun at disney or not be actually subject to who you go with , and not entirely about the park itself . crazy think ? perhaps , but i ' ve be many time and while i usually have a nice time at the park , it ' s usually because i ' m have fun with the person i go with . i ' m a big disney fan , though i think walt would be disappoint in many of the change , especially change in customer service . last week i have a very disquieting moment at the plaza ice cream spot in the magic kingdom . while wait in line to get my ice cream , one of the woman ( older ) work the register turn to a younger woman on her register. `` how many hour you get next week ? `` `` ugh , seven. `` `` i get too many hour next week , i don ' t want ' em ! ugggh this last half hour be go to go so slow . . . `` what the hell ? not only be this unacceptable in any business , but it ' s appal to have this happen at disney world . walt would be roll in his grave ! and sadly , this isn ' t a infrequent a i ' d like to think . many cast member just weren ' t that interested in speak with guest . they clump up and give off the vibe that they just want to talk about what they be up to that weekend . super disappointing . other spot where disney be lose it touch : - the merchandise be all . the . same . it doesn ' t matter what gift shop you go into . it ' s literally all the same crap . it ' s poorly make crap from china , too . that wonderful villain en vogue store at hollywood studio ? gutted . it ' s now hose mostly vinylmation now . - the price keep go up , up , up every year but the quality be go down , down , down . - the ride need update asap . the resort could also use some disney magic , but it seem a though their top dollar be go into the dvc resort , which be a shame . - this be where i ' m probably go to get slam for potentially fat- shaming . be aware that i be not . but the scooter have get so bad that i ' m definitely go to be rent a car next time instead of take the free disney transportation . each scooter take away six seat from other people . each bus be load up about three scooter each . it be frustrate to be stand around in line with horrible , bleed blister on each foot for about twenty minute . and then the bus would come , and a scooter and their family would roll up literally right before the bus get there and get on immediately and then i ' d end up have to wait for another bus just to repeat the process . they seem to rent those thing out to everyone , include teenager who just want to whiz around the park all afternoon . leave them for the people who need them ! - the halloween party be not worth the extra $ 70. it be basically pay $ 70 to have an extra few hour in the magic kingdom , just with a halloween theme firework show and parade , and to have access to halloween merchandise . : \ thing i still love : - epcot food and wine festival . one of the best event i ' ve be to . it ' s a blast . - free dining ! this make a large difference for u . we love the free dining because we still love the disney restaurant . - new fantasyland be a lot of fun ! the new little mermaid ride be exactly what i want to see from the park in the future . - nostalgia factor .",0,715
"i stay here during a recent trip to orlando in january 2013 and after my stay here i be definitely a fan ! if i ever return back to the orlando area this will defiantly be one of the first place i look to for reasonably price accommodation . 2. ) location : caribe cove be locate about 20 minute from the orlando airport and 15 minute ( give or take a few depend on traffic ) to any of the area attraction . the property be a bit off `` the main drag '' so what what you get be accommodation in a fairly quiet area . for me it be close enough to `` las vega - family style '' ( what i call the area ) but far enough away so that once you arrive at caribe cove , you can actually relax . there be also several supermarket , shop area and restaurant nearby to pick up any incidental you might need during your stay . i always felt safe at caribe cove because all car have to enter through a security gate that be staff during the overnight ( and early morning : ) ) hour . i felt very safe and secure while we be there with a well lit park lot , stairwell and hallway throughout the complex . 5 ) accommodation : my friend and i share a two bed room rental on the fourth floor of build 1 and actually for the two of u it be a bit large : ) . one bedroom have a queen bed and the second have two double bed . a full bathroom be attach to each bedroom . all bedding and towel ( bathroom and pool ) be provide and there be plenty of space to store our clothing and luggage . the kitchen be spacious and contain your standard appliance ( microwave , oven , fridge , and dishwasher ) . there be also plenty of newish cookware ( all matching ) and dishware/ utensil for about 6- 8 people . our rental also have central air conditioning , full service cable and free wi- fi . i sleep in the room with the double bed and the comfort level of the mattress and pillow be ok. . definately take some get use to and by the time i do it be time to leave : ( there be also a separate room with a washer and dryer which would be great for those spend a week or more in the area . come from new england i appreciate the enclose porch where i spend many hour during my stay . 4. ) service : not much to speak of a you be responsible for the cleanliness of your accommodation . they do charge a what i think to be a reasonable cleaning fee to return your rental to it previous state prior to the next occupant arrival . bin be locate by the parking lot for trash disposal . 5 ) extra : caribe cove have a gym locate in the club house . it be not big but have two good quality treadmill and a universal ( ha ! ) machine . they also have a outdoor , heat pool and hot tub with plenty of lounge chair and umbrella . there be also dvds that be available for rental to watch in your rental and the movie be mostly recent releasesi be also pleasantly surprise to find that they have a mini convenience store with incidental that be reasonably price and . . . . coffee and hot tea available all day and evening . a plus consider i have to have my caffeine and my roommate do not . 5. ) impression : i can not say enough great thing about caribe cove . a i have never stay in a rental while on vacation , i have some reservation but after stay here i can say that compare to what you will pay for many of the hotel in the area ( many of which do not have kitchen include ) - this be a great option for those look to maximize their travel experience while not spend a fortune .",1,714
"alright where do one start ? first of all i would like to say that not everyone that give this rat hole 1 star be a single , straight and sexually deprive woman that get drag there . i ' d also like to add that i be a local and not from out of town . even if some of u be straight doesn ' t mean we don ' t know a shit hole when we see one . this place apparently have be open since the 1980 ' s and have be in foreclosure for awhile now . after spend a few hour there i now know why it be in foreclosure and why it ' s lack luster reputation proceeds itself . if you can get past the fact that it ' s centrally locate in the worst area of orange county couple with the fact that there be prostitute and cop on literally every corner then by all mean go and waste a ton of money there ! the parking lot be spacious but dirty and no security that i saw . a you walk up you see the balcony of the hotel where i be make to witness not only men troll slowly by each window , peer in to see if there be anyone ready to invite him in for some apparent nondiscriminatory sex . . . . but i get the pleasure of witness some man come out with just a shirt on and nothing below the waistline his `` jiggly bit '' for anyone to see . a i walk into the club itself the pungent smell of urine and vomit engulf my nasal passage . thankfully the staff that take my money at the door be not friendly so i wasn ' t make to feel i have to stand there smell that and suffer through meaningless babble . i go to the bar and sit with friend a i wait for the theater to open and we order two drink and it come out to $ 19 ! a lukewarm budweiser and a vodka and red bull that be full to the top of the glass with ice . if i want to pay that much for ice i would have take a trip to the yukon . basically the main percentage of the staff suck at customer service , they have bad attitude and when you have a complaint everyone magically take on a managerial status ( i. e. `` theater manager , ushering manager , bar manager '' ) yet everyone pass the buck , be condescend and snarky and couldn ' t find their own as if it have a bell on it . the patron be middle to over- age , sleazy , dirty and no doubt 99 % of them have criminal record . the building be run down , dirty , smelly , unsanitary and god help you if you fancy the idea of stay the night there . . . no doubt you will need a tetanus shot before and after a well a serious bleach to get rid of all the dna splatter in the room . i be there on the night kelis play and thankfully leave before the bulk of the shenanigan start . . . no doubt you would be trip over use rubber and cocaine baggies to get up to the bar for yet another over price cup of ice with a splash of actual liquor ( for color of course ) . when this place have finally have one to many undercover sting on the property , one too many sexual proposition in the parking lot , one too many story in the medium . . . . . it will hopefully shut down for good . i have be to plenty of gay and lesbian bar , club and resort up and down the east coast and never have have the one of a kind experience that i have at this establishment . they will take your money , treat you unprofessionally and discourteously , and most of all live up to every rumor and bad review you ' ve heard and then some !",0,710
"before we could check in , since we have arrive about 15 minute earlier than expect , they shoo u away , say the earliest we could get the room be at 3pm , perhaps later . this be reasonable . but , right afterwards we be direct to an adjacent booth , where another attendant try to convince u to visit wyndham ' s other nicer hotel in exchange for cheaper theme park ticket . almost immediately , i know this be a timeshare scam , and try to get out of the conversation . she be very persistent , say that 2 hour of our time ( the min requirement to get the deal ) be nothing . i really do not like the up- selling tactic she try to use , and i actually have a friend who have to deal with wyndham legally to get out of a timeshare contract that she wasn ' t aware she have ever agree to . after deal with the saleswoman , my husband and i check in . the first thing we notice when we go to the room be a very rickety look door . if it didn ' t have a deadbolt on it , i probably would have ask for a different room right then and there . that night , i find ant crawl everywhere , most noticeably around the bathroom vanity , dresser drawer , and end table . to make thing worse , although they advertise that they provide wifi , they don ' t have this amenity . you do have access to the internet , but it be not wireless , and limit to one computer ( in the room ) at a time . despite these inconvenience , we stick with it for a few day . a combination of fatigue ( from travel , time zone difference , run a half marathon in orlando , and little sleep ) , tight vacation schedule , and what seem like limited alternative at the time , keep u from demand a different room . however , by the fourth day , we come back to find our door unlatched . housekeep hadn ' t close the door entirely after cleaning , and the door be expose . anyone could have walk in while we be go , which be approximately 10 hour . luckily , we store our expensive item in a safe , but what if someone have be wait there to steal from u ? i be outrage . housekeep have not diligently replace our towel , and a the day progress , they also get a little sloppier on make the bed . the shower be clog from previous visitor , so i have to pull out a lot of hair before i could clean myself ( immediately after unclog the tub , i proceed to wash my hand for several minute ; this be not nearly long enough ) . the bathroom also have no fan or window for ventilation . before they agree to switch room , we have to explain the situation , and in the process , dealt with rolling eye and purse lip from one of the employee . the other associate be kind enough to move u without charge . i notice a huge difference : the water pressure be noticeably stronger ( the sink faucet and shower head practically drip in the previous one ) , no ant , nicer appliance , stronger blow dryer , and sturdier door . the second room be about what i be expect for what we pay . i ' m not sure why there be a huge difference between the room . maybe it be an upgraded unit . what i be aware of be that we pay for what be advertise to be a 3 to 3 . 5 star hotel , and the first room i stay in be worse than some lower end motel i ' ve personally stay in . i do look for a deal , but i would say that the quality provide for the whole week be le than satisfactory , even on bargain .",0,708

"we stay at the oak plantation resort in kissimmee this summer . we be not timeshare owner and this be a timeshare resort . my wife have get a certificate for a one week stay and this place look exciting . but before we leave , my wife read some review and it unnerve her . but what be we go to do ? when we arrive we be greet by friendly front office staff but our room be not ready so we walk around , check out the pool and then go to lunch . when we be able to check into our room or should i say suite , we be pleasantly surprise . it be a two story townhouse with an upstairs bedroom and living room , din room and kitchen downstairs . everything look new except the upstairs deck , which have old plastic chair that be certainly weather worn . overall , it be nice but only include the bare essential . we also never have someone come in to clean the whole week we be there . they have two pool that be clean , warm and invite . believe me we use the pool a lot since it be hot ! their pool towel be actually small bath towel , a little larger than a hand towel . there be a bar at the pool which be just a shack , nothing exciting . it be advertise a a tiki bar , but there be no polynesian aspect what so ever and the exotic drink be serve in plastic dixie cup ( false advertising there ) . the pool be virtually empty every day ( be the place empty or be everyone at the park , who know but that make it all the more enjoyable ) . back to the bar , the bartender be not attentive . they also didn ' t come around to ask if anyone want something or clean up or straighten up around the pool area . one day , they have a woman come out to cook hotdog and since it be rain she wouldn ' t turn the grill on . she also be nasty to one of the other guest who have ask if she be grill . another day we be at the pool around 10 : 30 and the first customer the bar have be at 4 : 00 ( their happy hour ) . he sit there with his phone all day listen to music . we meet another couple that be timeshare owner and they say that it use to be party central in the ninety and have go downhill ever since . we check and read more complaint from other timeshare owner . luckily , we only receive one call regard purchase a timeshare . we ignore it . i don ' t know what the staff do all day , since garbage outside our building be there for three day before someone clean it up , and there be trash in the foliage . we also notice from our second floor that the gutter weren ' t clean in age . hence when it rain it overflow . they have a breakfast room and a general store . we never go to breakfast but do go to the general store . the beer in the general store be cheaper than at the bar . we also learn that you have to pay cash at all three place and couldn ' t charge it back to your room . ridiculous . overall , i can ' t complain because it cost u almost nothing to stay there and i believe we stay in one of the unit that they show to potential client . we have drive to the back of the resort and those unit look like they need a lot of work . i like the fact that it be not crowd but now it ' s prime have come and go and yet , they could do so much to this place !",0,687
"none of the review capture the real problem with this resort . we just return from what would have be a disaster of a disney weekend . we ' re annual passholders and want to try something new . i ' ve get two toddler and we go to disney all the time . this would have be our worst weekend . base on review we ask for a `` pirate '' room . we never even saw the room so i don ' t know what they look like inside . . . . check in be at a stand alone building , which in and of itself be a total let down . . . after drive , you want your kid to have the excitement of a new fun place . i have call earlier to ask about a room closer to the pool and amenity , reservation tell me it would be in the system . when we check in , we be direct to the building which be the farthest away from any amenity . . . building # 39. the check in girl say , `` we ' ll it ' s quiet. `` worse , it be on the 2nd floor . now , when you ' re an annual pas holder checking in with two infant . . . and when i make my reservation tell them we ' re celebrate infant birthday , you would think disney would know that with stroller and luggage a 2nd floor room would not work . i dump my wife and kid at the end of the earth ( build 39 ) then drive all the way back to the front . . . it ' s like a mile on the road . i complain about the second floor and how far away we be . . . . the manager intervene . . . . . and put u on a similarly far away room on the first floor of build 38 ! the pool out there at the end of the world be just old tired pool . . . and the resort itself be old and tired . . . although they be spruce it up . . . put lipstick on a pig we call it . fortunately we didn ' t have to mess around with the bus back and forth , but that would have be impossible with stroller and toddler . . . . and from what we saw , there be nothing at this dump , ( my wife call it the endless holiday inn ) that would keep anyone occupied . i be infuriate that no one care that we be upset , and that management be so unconcerned . i just can not understand why , when this be not a crazy pack weekend , we would be place in room at the end of the earth . after locate my wife and two toddler who be leave to travel the ground ( my two year old saying over and over `` don ' t like this , don ' t like this '' ) i pack u into the car and we have a perfect , amazing , totally what we expect from disney stay at the wilderness lodge . i be literally prepared to just drive away , feel rip off and rob by disney . . but you don ' t do that with kid . we ' re fortunate to live in florida so we can redo or change , but if you come from out of state . . . with lot of expectation , this experience would be painfully devastate . i also find it quite disconcert that after we have problem , and i be call in to change at lodge , no one care to follow up at all . . . they take all these survey every single time you call in , but it doesn ' t matter when you ' ve get an infuriated guest on site ?",0,685
"i have no idea why this place only have an overall rating of 3 star on yelp , unless maybe there be some older review on here that be create before this hotel be renovated/ updated and those outdated review be drag down the overall score ? i bid $ 55/ night on a downtown hotel use priceline , arrive on friday and depart on sunday and be award this crown plaza . after see that this hotel have 3 star overall , i wasn ' t expect much . i be really pleasantly surprised ! when one arrive , you can either self- park or valet , and when you walk in , you notice right away that the lobby be update and modern look . the 2 gentleman who check me in be almost overly friendly and accommodate , ask if i want 2 double or a king , if a 4th floor room be ok , etc . when i open the door to the room , i be surprise by the level of accommodation , and right away say to myself `` my fellow yelpers get this one wrong , this be not a 3 star propertly '' . i be also shock that i get this room for the price i pay for it ! the room appear to be recently update , and the decor be modern and even trendy . there ' s a large led tv on the wall with interactive tv and pay per view , a small kitchenette with sink , coffee maker and microwave ( no fridge ) , and a free- standing wardrobe closet with a safe at the bottom . the desk/ dresser , wardrobe , kitchenette and night stand be dark espresso wood with brushed nickel handle , and the countertop in the bathroom and kitchenette be granite . there be boutique soap , shampoo and lotion in the bathroom , and on the bed be a set of lotion and mist to help one relax , sleep and recharge after a journey . the room itself be carpteted , but the foyer and bathroom be tile . the bed be very comfy to sleep in , and the l- shape couch be also a bonus . these be perfect room not only to stay in , but also for entertain . on the saturday i be here , i really need to get some work do , so i open the door , tell room service i be stick around and didn ' t need towel or the bed make , but i do ask for a packet of coffee . the woman grab what i ' d ask for from her cart , walk over to me with a big smile on her face , hand me the item i ' d request and wish me a great day . wifi here be complimentary and be quite fast so i be able to work away all morning without be burden by the slow wifi that one sometimes experience at other hotel . note that there be a charge for park ( $ 15/ night ) and you will hear a lot of traffic noise from both colonial drive and nearby i- 4 that can be annoy , especially when you ' re try to fall asleep but aren ' t overly tire and the horn honking jolt you awake . note a well that , while each room do have a very small balcony , the french door lead out to the balcony be lock with a deadbolt that patron can ' t open , and there ' s signage indicate that they must remain locked at all time . with that in mind , there be no access to the balcony ( even in the case of fire , which be a bit unnerving ) , no way to get fresh air into the room , and the french door don ' t seem well seal , which explain the traffic noise i mentoined above .",1,683

( no , it wasn ' t the special artisanal process. ) and what be post a ' key lime pie ' arrive at room temperature , wasn ' t pie and taste nothing like key lime . the tasteless whip top add to the disappointment . i call to ask if i ' d receive something different in error but the young lady agree that she ' d taste it and it didn ' t have the tang that people would expect from key lime . she volunteer to remove it from the charge but i would have prefer to pay double for everything and not be disappoint . be homesick for the neapolitan dop buffalo mozzarella , we ask if we could pay extra for an entire ball of cheese . we be willing to pay $ 25. ' not a problem ' , be the response . yes , a problem when it be receive . apparently the cheese be receive frozen in individual plastic bag . so that ' s how ours be deliver . partially unfrozen in it sealed plastic bag . yuck . this cheese doesn ' t improve with freezing ; it break down the texture into something akin to ancient cottage cheese . and it should be serve thirty minute after be remove from the refrigerator , when expose to ambient temperature . let me put it this way . fool me once ( about quality ) , shame on your minion . fool me twice , shame on my misplaced sense of optimism . or more succintly : the best hindsight be experience only once .",0,683

"this be a lovely , enormous hotel in which we spend a week . we have a room face northwest on the 21st floor and the view be spectacular ! the room itself have very comfortable bed , but the fridge have no freezer section so the ice cream we order from room service would not keep for later . there be no microwave which mean you have to eat out most all the time . why be it that the more expensive the hotel , the fewer include service they have ? the free wi- fi drop you if you stay on too long and offer a better service for a fee . it be rather slow . there be several very good restaurant in the lobby . i would especially recommend the everglades , which be a bit more pricey , but worth it in imaginative choice and service a well a presentation of the course . there be a restaurant that have a large buffet for all meal and the staff be friendly and helpful , even if they do spend an inordinate amount of time chat loudly with each other in the back of the restaurant . we recommend use a waitress name ruthie , who be a real kick and very efficient and helpful . the deli be sort of like a little market where you can get snack , etc , but the price be high . the bar have a lot of choice , but their serving be all presentation and not much food . henry ' s be a cafe- type restaurant that be outside by the pool . my shrimp taco be excellent , but the reggae performer by the pool screech like a die seagull . fortunately the hotel be centrally locate and very close to a whole mall of restaurant . parking be not $ 15/ night , just $ 15 for our entire stay but you have to park way in the back in covered parking and walk what seem a quarter mile from the back door to the front elevator to get to your room . when i come back from a morning of shopping , it be quite a trek to bring my purchase up to my room . if you use valet parking , you may use the front door , which be close to all elevator and the front desk . they guard the front curb from regular user , but grudgingly permit you to use it for pick up and drop off passenger . everything do seem gear to add to the bill . i leave one morning , early and do not get back until 1 pm . i find my room still have not be make up , even though two maid two door down have spend 15 min chat with each other with their respective cart fill up the hallway , when i ask what time the maid would be come , i be tell she would be there soon . she be not and they make no effort to fix the problem themselves . i call the desk to arrange for an early morning clean up for each day and then have a maid interrupt our nap in the late afternoon , loudly knock , not wait between knock session , three timesin immediate succession , then attempt to open the door ! we call to her to please wait and she do , but by that time we do not want to be disturb . they must have a rule the maid have to knock three separate time , but she choose to run them all together without enough space to respond . once , in our week ' s stay , a maid actually clean the room in the be while i be go . once . the view really be the best part of this hotel , so see if you can get a `` room at the top '' .",1,675

"i recently stay here for 9 day during march 2016 and overall be very impressed with the hotel and it amenity . i be attend a professional conference in the attached convention center , which be a lovely experience and will be look forward to lobby for this hotel to be use again ! the good : my balcony on the 8th floor overlook st. augustine , and it felt like i have the best room in the place ( i didn ' t , but it felt sublime ! ) . every night i leave the french door open and listen to the waterfall lull me to sleep . park for me be free ( or comped ? not sure . . . ) , but our experience find a parking space vary widely from day to day . i order room service 3- 4 time and each time it be bring up within a reasonable time , and the service be courteous . the food be standard fare , nothing adventurous , and price what you would expect for room service ( a bit higher than the restaurant ) . the pillow be soooo soft and cushy and i sleep great on the bed . the quality of the sushi bar/ restaurant be great , especially the crab bisque . they have an easter egg hunt which be really cute and an easter bunny which my daughter enjoy . super- convienent to the park and to the airport ! the meh : be kid- friendly be a blessing and a curse . i have my daughter for the last few day there and she love the `` castle '' in st. augustine , the boat in key west , and the koi and gator . it be easy to entertain her ! sadly , many parent let their kid run free and crazy in the expansive ground and hold `` race '' in the hotel hallway . my 2 year old be nearly run over a couple time by rude big kid . early morning be a lot of bang door , cry kid , etc get ready for the park or check out ; but , thats orlando ! i need a crib and request one the night before i need it . i call again the next day an hour before i need it and 2 hour later it finally arrive ( ouch nap time ) . the line for coffee at the price- increase starbucks be very very long and the in- room coffee be sub- par . the ugly : my room key stop work halfway through my stay and we get lock out of the parking lot too after a long day at epcot . reach the front desk by phone to correct this required 15 min on hold . a cheerlead convention arrive on the last few day and take over the hotel . oh man- cartwheeling and cheering , glitter spray on everything , it be loud , even in the `` adult only '' area like the bar ( in there with their parent ? ! ) and adult pool . the tax , fee , resort tax add up fast but be not the fault of the hotel really . but man , they hit those tourist . the restaurant be very expensive for what you get , i ' d recommend eat offsite , but do try the sushi place ( $ $ $ $ $ though ) . wrecker be a nice place for a beer but get crowd . verdict : by all mean come ! i ' ll be back too , but i ' ll be ask next time the kind of convention that will be run concurrently next time ( no cheerleading ) . for a disney trip though , for the same price you can get extra magic hour at a disney hotel which be a nice perk .",1,667
"i ' ve stay at all three of the resort on property at universal studio . this be our 2nd favorite hotel there ( our favorite be hard rock hotel ) . i do have to say that this hotel still get an `` excellent '' rating from me because loews hotel rarely disappoint on any level . the lobby of the hotel be great . very pacific asian and in the middle of the lobby be a wonderful tranquil water garden enclose that have a lilly pond , elephant blow water in the pond . . . it ' s really a nice touch to the lobby . valet be always easy , however the self parking here be pretty quick to get to . if you don ' t want to valet , then just drive up , drop your stuff to a bellman and go park the car . the royal pacific be a nicer version of the disney polynesian hotel . it ' s newer , more opulent and have much better amenity . the room here be nice . decent size and nicely appoint . i ' ve stay in the king suite and it ' s my favorite . this visit be a quick 2 night stay without our kid , so we just take a regular hotel room overlook the pool . the hotel have an emiril ' s restaurant call the chop chop ( or something like that ) it ' s fantastic , but expensive a you ' d expect from one of these top shelf eat establishment . this nice part be that since it ' s at the hotel and on universal studio property , but also this allow you to dress much more casual than you ' d plan to go to a restaurant of this caliber . they do have a little shop where you can buy needed item and a very nice boutique where you can buy tommy bahama clothes , stylish lady pool wear and other assort `` nice '' item . i do find a pair of flip flop that be only about $ 20 , but there be reef brand and i still use them today . the pool be really what make the resort . both hard rock & amp ; royal pacific have great pool and it ' s a toss up to which be better . i like the sand at hard rock , however the water play area for kid be top notch at royal pacific . they both have virtually the same poolside menu . i love the chicken nacho and get them every time we go there . they be fantastic ! ok. . . finally the biggest perk for stay at lowes on universal property ? your room key allow you one hour early to harry potter and skip the line at every ride at universal & amp ; island of adventure . you can buy fast pas ticket when you enter the park , but they vary from about $ 50+ per person ! you put a couple people in your royal pacific room and it literally just pay for itself . if you ' re go exclusively to universal , i highly suggest this or the hard rock hotel . . . . i really don ' t like portofino bay at all . it the most expenisve and worst hotel of them all . whatever you do . . . do not take kid here . portofino be horrible . just take my advice and stay at the other two . they be far far better hotel . overall . . . . a great stay for family , couple and even fly solo . lot to do , see and meet . oh lastly , the breakfast buffet be a little expensive , but it ' s really good and even have a kid buffet .",1,664

"let me start with the positive - the hotel have easy access to disney ( if that ' s on your list of destination ) and the entire staff be pleasant and invite . overall the hotel lobby and public area be very nicely do . the negative - we book a resort view room ( and know that the view would not be the nicest but we get to overlook the roof of the front entrance ) . the room be handicap accessible even though we never ask for such a room . this normally doesn ' t bother me , but unfortuantely the up keep in the room be not the best and the shower head fell down the rod in the middle of the shower so you have to constantly push it back up . not a problem if i be lay in the bathtub to take a shower , but certainly not acceptable for those of u who stand to shower . now , the room be well . . . a hotel room ( comparable to maybe a hampton inn or hilton garden inn room at best ) . the biggest negative to me be the fact the hotel nickle and dime you to death . i be tell when i book that there would be a $ 14 per day resort fee . that include 2 bottle of water , 60 minute of telephone call , internet service and use of the fitness center . seeing be that we be only stay one night and not plan on spend a ton of time in the hotel , the fitness center be not go to be use . however , the internet be go to be helpful a we want to make dinner reservation and research some other item . unfortuantely , the internet service be terrible - take forever to connect then kick you off about 2 minute later . i needt to metnion that the hotel be a dead zone for any sort of decent data speed on your cell phone so you be basically stick use their internet ( i have at & amp ; t for cell provider ) . ok - so scratch the internet from the fee you be leave with 2 bottle of water and 60 minute of local call . since it 2013 i doubt i will use the telephone in my room for anything so now you have 2 bottle of water for 14 buck ( assume you don ' t use the fitness center and a i previously say we only stay one night and didn ' t use the fitness center ) . but the fee don ' t stop there - oh no ! ! ! you get the joy of pay $ 15 per night to self park your car ( in a lot a considerable distance from the entrance to the hotel ) or $ 20 to valet park your car . so a not to sound like a prude i don ' t have a problem pay for park in a big city like new york or chicago ( where parking be at a premium ) , but this hotel be in the middle of disney world and there be park galore ! you basically have no choice but to pay the parking fee if you drive to orlando like i do . i just find it crazy they charge you a park fee when many of the hotel in the immediate area ( the disney resort include ) do not charge you a nightly park fee . so with all that say , i will highly doubt i will ever stay at this property again . there be fair many other ( and better ) option available .",0,639

( i ' m not take point off for this but the fitness center be on the main floor inside split inside two hotel room . one be weight , one be cardio . both space be too small . i understand the construction aspect and have not deduct anything from my review for it . just want to make those travel aware ) . it get two star because of the people who work there . the staff that we meet be all friendly and you could tell they be all work hard despite the circumstance . again , if we have pay full price , i ' d give this 0 star . maybe once construction be complete , this place will have thing that work and timely food . i pay for the view and a bed to sleep in and that be pretty much it . no one want to be inconvenience when they be on vacation and this place do not make life easier .",0,638
"i would like to tell you about my interesting ( not in a good way ) 5 day stay at the day inn in kissimee , fl . my parent and my son and i take a trip to orlando to go to disney world and universal studio . my father book this hotel on the way down because it be relatively close to both park and be say to have clean room and a big continental breakfast in the morning . my father can be somewhat frugal when spend money on hotel , but i believe after this experience that have change . our story begin here . . . day 1- check in time be at 3 pm we arrive at 2 : 35 pmbelieving that wouldn ' t be a problem . my father go to check in and he be tell to go somewhere else and come back at 3. we occupy ourselves and come back a little after 3 , my father then go back into check in where he wait for almost an hour a the hotel manager argue with a woman in line about a coupon that be in a visitor magazine about a deal they be offer and ask her if she know how to read and tell her she could not receive that coupon deal for all night . basically an unneeded scene in front of other customer . we then go to our hotel room which be clean not the nicest room but clean . day 2- we get up early to head to the magic kingdom and head down to the continental breakfast . when we arrive there be nothing out but toast a single toaster and some generic raisin brand and frost flake with an empty warm food cart . we think we must be early and wait for more food . . . it never come that be it ! i watch a man fill his cereal bowl with coffee creamer because there be no milk . day 3- still no breakfast . we leave and head to the beach this day my father place the do not disturb sign on the door . when we arrive back later that night the do not disturb sign have be rip off the door and the maid have enter anyway . she seem to have just clean up a bit and nothing be miss . . . but still very shady ! day 4- still no breakfast . they offer a laundry service so my parent go to do laundry where it cost $ 1 . 50 in quarter and they do not have enough quarter , so when they could not find a change machine they go to the front desk to ask for some quarter . they be tell they do not have any and to walk down to the cv down the street and see if they could give them quarter . great service . . . i know . i be out with my son but i give them quarter when i get back and then my father throw the wet clothe into what he think be a dryer that turn out to be another washer full of already used water that smell like sewage , and then out of quarter have to wash the clothes in our hotel bath tub . . . gross . day 5- still no breakfast . my son decide he want to go to the pool when we arrive the whole pool be tap off with caution tape . . . totally sketchy . all in all unless you be on spring break and look for a cheap hotel to party in with your friend i would advise you to stay elsewhere .",0,634

"affordable , comfortable , good amenity , good price . i spend nearly a week here for cisco live 2013 in june . i pick it out of a dozen conference hotel because it be cheapest ( under $ 90 i think include tax ) and be on one of the shuttle route . i have relatively low expectation , but i figure i ' d have to pay for it out of my own pocket so i wasn ' t go to go with a $ 250 room . turn out , it be one of the better hotel i ' ve stay in , especially for the price . check- in be a bit slow , with 3- 4 people handle the checkins and three or four conference check in at the same time , but it wasn ' t too bad . i get a 10th floor room at the far end of the property , toward the occc ( where the conference be hold ) . the room be comfortable . it be swelter outside , so the ac never really stop while i be there , and the internet connection never really start once cisco live attendee start show up . but a networking nerd put it , `` at # clus , your hotel ' s wifi will be measure , test , and find wanting. `` and 4g verizon coverage be respectable . one of the strangest thing i find about this hotel be that the property amenity be generous and inexpensive . there ' s a convenience store that ' s open 24/ 7 with sandwich , snack , drink , a modest grocery selection , etc . price be very reasonable . the gift shop , with the obvious disneyana focus , have fair price for everything i look at . the buffet restaurant have a good breakfast , hot and cold option , with coffee and the extra- cost juice and tax and tip for about $ 11. compare that to the $ 20 you ' ll pay at most hotel for a similar experience . the in- room coffee be a pod- base single serve system , and to be honest their coffee pod be the main disappointment of the stay ( unless you count lose my fitbit one somewhere between my room and the convention center the second day , which be not the hotel ' s fault of course ) . i bring my own anyway , so it be not a bad thing , and i be able to get whole milk for a fair price to go with the coffee . the soda machine in the hotel tower be very affordable- - it be either a dollar or $ 1 . 50 for a soda or water . there be a laundry room with 3- 4 washer and dryer in each building . the price be reasonable but i didn ' t find the laundry at a time when it wasn ' t overwhelm by family need to do their laundry . end up do some `` sink suds '' in my room but have i think about it earlier , i could have do a late night batch of laundry for maybe $ 3. there be a couple of pool . . . but they close at 10pm . i didn ' t have much time for the pool anyway , so this be a negligible inconvenience . there ' s a lot of shopping and din opportunity within walk distance a well . next year ' s cisco live be in san francisco , but if i end up in orlando again and need a hotel , i wouldn ' t hesitate to stay here .",1,633

"the hotel be now the clarion inn at lake buena vista . i have to wonder if the previous negative reviewer be stay at the same hotel we be in because my family ' s experience at the clarion lbv be extremely different than theirs . pro : first and foremost , their florida resident rate be affordable for any family travel on a budget . secondly , their `` kid eat free '' option be phenomenal . in many case , the `` kid eat free at our hotel buffet '' consists of a stale bagel and a cup of coffee , but not so at the clarion lbv . the breakfast buffet , which also include a buy one/ get one offer for the adult be replete with good food to choose from . scramble egg , bacon , sausage , mickey mouse waffle , pancake , and an array of topping to choose from . between the bogo discount and the free kid discount , our family of four ate breakfast every morning for under $ 11. that ' s cheaper than four breakfast value meal at mcdonald ' s ( and a lot better for you ) . our room be clean . the sheet and floor be clean and except for some graffiti on the bathroom wall ( apparently kayla love kevin in 2012 ) , we have no complaint . the housekeeping staff be pleasant and respect our `` sleeping in '' one morning and we be always furnish with extra towel and washcloth when we request them . our shower be comfortable and pip hot and both our child enjoy take a bath in the bathtub . the microwave in the room be very convenient a we be a family travel on a budget and could heat up frozen pizza ( conveniently sell in the lite bite in the hotel lobby at very reasonable price ) to avoid have to shell out big buck at the various chain restaurant in the area . the fridge keep our drink cold , which be exactly what a fridge should do . restaurant staff , porter , bus driver , housekeeping , maintenance and security staff be extremely helpful and polite . con : the shuttle bus to disney run on a timed schedule , not continuously every 30 minute or so . therefore , if you miss the 10 : 30 be bus you have to wait until the next one arrive at 11 : 15 or 1 : 05. the return bus run in the same fashion so if you ' ve get a scream toddler and a cranky kindergartener at magic kingdom and you want to leave right now ! ! ! ! ! ! , you can ' t. you have to wait for your schedule pickup time ( which can be a bit frustrate ) . there be no shuttle bus to downtown disney . the heated pool could use a bit more heating . the front desk staff could use some customer service training in smile and not roll their eye when you don ' t understand them because 1 ) they have a thick accent and 2 ) they ' re talk fast because they don ' t seem like they want to be bother with explain thing to you . all in all , we enjoy our stay at the clarion lbv . we weren ' t look for luxurious suite or pamper treatment . we be look for a decently price , comfortable , clean and friendly hotel that would let u collapse at the end of a long day at the disney park . the clarion certainly deliver . thanks clarion lbv !",1,627
"all in all this be a great resort . i would recommend this to anyone with connection to our armed force . it have many thing go for it . 1. location . it be close to the magic kingdom and the polynesian resort . this second tidbit of info be good because you can walk to the polynesian ( ~ 10min ) and catch a monorail into the park . you could also drive or bus to the transportation and ticket center and either ferry or monorail over from there . be so close mean you can easily go in for the morning , leave at the hot part of the day to get lunch , go to the pool , ( or nap ! ) and return later fully recharge for the parade and firework . 2. easy transport to the park . there be buss that take you to all the major park and disney spring right from the hotel . the bad part : most only run once per hour . : ( the bus to the ttc run every 20min i think . 3. have a good aafes store . this be great for buy food/ drink/ alcohol/ souvenir without pay disney price . 4. pool . they have multiple pool on property . one have a large tube slide for the kid and a splash park for the little one . my kid love it ! they even have life vest and goggles for you to borrow if you need them . 5. room . room be big and spacious . bigger than the one at the disney french quarter resort i stay at recently . we have 2 queen and a couch which be a sleeper in our room . it have a nice balcony too . 6 . $ $ $ $ $ . this will be much cheaper than what you will pay even at the lower tier disney resort . even lower if you be junior enlist ! 1. no mickey . the only hint of disney i saw at the entire hotel be a mickey statue in the lobby and some movie play at reception . if you be come down , and especially if you have kid , i be guess you want to get the feeling that you be at disney . but this may not be a big deal since you be save a bunch on the room rate . 2. no magic band . so if you stay on any other disney property you will be able to enter and exit your room with your magic band . not here . you also can not link you band to your room bill and pay for thing in the park ( very convenient ) . if you could , you could leave the room for the day with just your magic band and carry almost nothing else ! ( maybe your phone ) 3. transportation . good and bad . if you be go to epcot or to mk you have to take a bus to the ttc and then catch the ferry or monorail . at other disney resort they usually have a direct bus to each resort and then you don ' t get stick wait for your next connection to get where you want to go . also the bus to the other park don ' t run a frequently at sog a they do from other disney hotel . make sure you bring your guest id and mil id or you can ' t get on the bus ! just a tip . stay here and decide for yourself . i think you will like it !",1,625

"it ' s well- know that the swan and dolphin hotel be the only resort on disney property that be not actually disney own and operate . they be sheraton hotel and the corporation have a 99 year lease on the property , a i understand it . for the specific of this review , our experience be with the dolphin . to my knowledge , the largest difference between the two be that the dolphin room have two double bed whereas the swan room have two queen . first , the pro . . . these hotel generally offer great promotional rate that be far more competitive than disney resort . the actual property and common area be well do and offer an abundance of entertainment and dining option . additionally , they offer the unique benefit of a walk path to epcot ' s back entrance and hollywood studio ' main entrance , a well a boat transportation to the later park and disney ' s boardwalk and beach club hotel . there be really no need to use your own vehicle once arrive to the hotel since anything not locate within walk distance have a dedicate bus route . the room be very adequate , but nothing lavish . the bed be very comfortable , though the sheet seem to be too small for the mattress and keep come off . hotel staff be attentive and polite , though not exceed general expectation . now , the con . . . these property be show their age . from exterior paint that ' s fade to room that be due for an update , it seem that sheraton be overdue for at least a minor renovation . compare to other disney resort , or even other non- disney 4- star resort , the room be small . the bathroom sink area be downright cramp , literally a third the size of most area hotel . the towel be sub- par in quality and , though comfortable , the bed sheet do not fit the bed properly . one of the thing that people look forward to the most about a nice hotel room be how dark they get , ensure a refreshing sleep . unfortunately , the curtain do not quite provide this and either let light in through the center split or the outside edge , depend on which way you tug them . another thing that disappoint u be the fee . though the booked rate be excellent in my opinion , you get hit with either an $ 11 or $ 18/ day park fee , depend on whether you self park or valet , and an additional $ 10/ day resort fee ( that include internet , fitness center , etc . even if you do not utilize those feature ) . that do not sound like a lot , but tack on $ 20- 30/ day add up quickly and can diminish the attractive rate . also , note that no disney resort charge either of these fee . ( though many have a la carte pricing for internet , fitness center , etc. ) food be expensive , a expect at a resort , but the quality be good . the fresh marketplace buffet style restaurant be $ 20/ person for breakfast , but ultimately end up be the best value . all in all , this be a solid 3 . 5- star resort . it should be a 4- star , but a revamp of the room and fee schedule would be welcome .",1,605

"wish i could give a more positive rating a the property be nice and i be allow early check- in a my flight bring me here for a conference early . most hotel in the area be book up for a large worldwide conference , so i shack up at the very family- orient grande vista . front desk rep be nice and welcoming and i be give a room in a quiet part of the resort overlook the golf warm up area , range and green . after attend the second night of the conference , my uber be stop at the security gate and i be ask to show my keycard and provide room number . nice touch . i be drop off and head up to my room to prepare for a busy tomorrow . i hear loud banging on my door ( it ' s after midnight. ) they be demand i open it . i be travel alone so i look through the peephole to find a man stand there with no visibly identify marking on his clothing , so i quietly back away from the door hop this would be intruder would move on . my phone ring , it ' s the front desk order me to open the door , and security be outside . more banging on the door , more yelling . i open the door and the man ask me if i have a backpack. `` yes , it ' s right over there '' i respond , to which he demand to see it . think this would make him leave , i provide it . the man open it to find marketing document , a squeaky foam dinosaur and other trinket i ' ve pick up from my day at the conference expo . the man then explain he saw me run from the hotel ' s store and i be suspect of a robbery , and that he follow me to my room . i be surprise at this because my uber driver not only take me past the front gate ( staff by security ) but remind you that they ask me for my room number , which be accurately provide . this be the same number the uber drop me immediately outside of minute prior . i would think security would have some type of communication to understand they have just `` card me '' and i be be drop off via car . after the man leave , i call the front desk to complain and ask to speak to someone , anyone , who could explain this . i request the gm . understandably so , the gm be not on shift . i be transfer to a person who appear to sound like the man who have just visit my room . realize this would get me nowhere , i ask for the gm to contact me the next day . no callback , and again when the pleasant desk staff process my check out the next day ask `` how be your stay ? `` they receive a story similar to what you ' ve read here . no action from them , no follow- up , no explanation . too bad , this would have be a nice place to visit again later in life when i wasn ' t profile for have a backpack , enjoy the nightlife of a professional conference and look younger than your normal middle age , family clientele .",0,596
"the picturesque view from the porch make a visit - but not an overnight stay - to this hotel worthwhile . wish there be more to recommend but my first visit will definitely be my last . the property need to be constantly patrol to pick up the glass , dish and litter that seem to be everywhere all the time . even the bloody linen napkin provide to help my mom ' s cut stop bleeding when she trip on that previously mention picturesque verandah be leave in a heap on a small table next to the rocking chair for hour . more on that to come . the room be comfortable and seem to have be recently renovate but still show sign of wear and tear . the bathtub be so slick that it be an effort to make it through a shower without slip . we din in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast and can not really recommend anything from either meal . we sit in the bar because all of the outdoor table be take and the main dining room seem a little dark and dismal for our taste . we think breakfast would be a no brainer since we order scramble egg ( need seasoning ) , a biscuit ( tasteless ) , granola ( suppose to be house make and may have be but be definitely stale ) , fresh fruit ( seem a bit wilt ) and yogurt ( i assume it would be vanilla but it seem to be peach and have an uncanny resemblance to the publix brand of yogurt find in the grocery dairy case ) . but i guess the most disappointing feature be the lack of hospitality . there be little that make u feel welcome . don ' t sit there - that table be reserve . i think the store open around 9 or 10 a. m. here be direction to an urgent care clinic ( that printout be provide after my mother trip on a board on the hotel ' s front step and get a nasty bruise below her right eye and big , bloody bruise on her knee ) . there be much better way to re- direct folk din in your restaurant . can ' t imagine it be the first time anyone ever ask about local business hour so why so vague ? and really ? not an offer to drive her/ u to the clinic which be only three mile away ? we be both pretty shake up a well a be from out- of- town and not familiar with the area ? it be fate that another woman on the porch be a nurse who immediately spring into action to get ice and help apply pressure to mom ' s injury because no one else seem able to assist . by the way , mom be usually quite capable of get around . but the nurse who witness the accident point out that mom ' s shoe ( she be wear flat ) somehow get catch on the board which cause the fall . before we check out , i request a copy of the incident report . i also leave a voicemail for a member of the management staff to call me because i have a question and want to follow up about the fall . get the copy of the report . still wait for my phone call to be return . and that be why i will not return .",0,595

"an okay experience . pro : even though the hotel be `` fully book '' 650/ 750 room with 100 undergoing renovation at this time per front desk , it felt extremely quiet and be a nice escape from universal studio madness . there be three pool two of which be very quiet and clean . the water taxi work very well . if you have a chance , you might ask for room 2677. it be a two queen bed room with a nice view over the bay and a balcony you can sit on . room be in good repair and the bed be very comfortable . for those who pay for the club level , please be aware that there be no designated block of room . this mean you can have quite a walk to get to the lounge area . a little bit different than what i have be use to in the past . however , the club staff be excellent and evening hors d ' oeuvre be more than just a little snack . even menu might include spaghetti and meatball , flank steak , paella in addition to a selection of wine and cheese . this can be great for family who have child that be not very adventurous eater and tired parent who don ' t want to try to find restaurant food after a long day at the park . unfortunately , if you be travel without child you will need to put up with nicktoons on the tv , foot on the couch , and the occasional person who be gross enough to leave their half consume drink or food on the service area counter despite the effort of the staff to clean up a quickly a possible . overall it can be very worthwhile . if you be travel during this period universal studio be actually not that busy so there be limited advantage to the express pas that come with your room . however , if you be a harry potter fan , you can experience that part of the park in the morning which could make it worthwhile for many . please be aware that there be not anything else other than the carousel in seuss land open early - if you want to do anything else in the park you be out of luck . universal itself be look a little tired . i guess i ' m just use to disney . in comparison to club lounge , front desk staff be mediocre . a noted above we get book into a great room - unfortunately they do not tell u that the window in balcony be go to be totally cover with plastic and paint a they be do maintenance . this make the advantage of this room useless to u a it be to last for our entire stay . it should be do now so if you get it please enjoy ! when we go back to discuss this with the front desk there be limited option to rectify situation and a do not seem to be very apologetic or want to bend over backwards to assist . i also get double bill for my room when i check out - would not have know this except for have check my credit card bill after get home . since this come to over $ 2000 it be a bit of a mistake !",1,582

"can ' t say enough good thing about this place ! price : probably can ' t beat it for this area . i do a lot of comparison- shopping for the time we plan to visit - early december - and they have some of the best price with the amenity we want ( quiet , not overrun with child , + shuttle to universal ) . the facility themselves be new in a clean/ well- maintain sense , and retro in a design/ aesthetic sense . they be pleasantly well- lit without be too moody , or too bright , or too glare . they somehow manage to have great acoustic in the public aireas a well - even though there be many child around , their sound level be somehow deaden a bit and the cafeteria seating , buffet area , and even bowl arena never seem noisy . they really nail the ambiance here . the room be huge ! we have two queen bed , a ton of drawer and closet space , great tv + free wifi , perfectly clean towel , a large vanity/ sink area , lot of bathroom space , and a fabulous poolside view . i believe we just have a `` standard '' room , so i imagine the upgraded suite be even nicer . the blackout curtain lead to a very nice night ' s sleep , and we have no sound complaints whatsoever . i think the bowling area might have really gross food simply base on stereotype , but i be pleasantly impress . even the side salad be quite flavorful , and it ' s only $ 4. they have a full bar , which be great - we get in late our first night , didn ' t have a car , and be glad we could get decent food ( not just fast food or snack ) up until midnight . none of our meal here be fancy , but they be always hot , hearty and generously portion . the shuttle be quite prompt . keep in mind that the universal to cabana bay beach resort pickup spot be under the escalator you use to get up and down to the mezzanine entrance area of the resort . it ' s only about a mile or so from hotel to the studio - it be totally worth the extra peace and quiet to u . also , don ' t forget you get early access to harry potter world if you stay here ! we never find the line too overwhelming and opt to sleep in instead , but it would ' ve be helpful if we ' d come during peak time , for instance . we spend a few evening watch movie at the amc universal theater - so it ' s nice that the shuttle run all the way until 2 a. m. because we really do stay out almost that late one night . we weren ' t able to take advantage of the outdoor amenity because we spend all of our time at universal ( and it be cold outside ) , but the pool and surround area be really nicely lay out , and the many kid and family there seem to enjoy themselves a lot . we will always stay here when we come back to universal !",1,573
"i just return from a wdw trip and stay at the seralago for 4 night . i be actually pleasantly surprised - - you get a lot of value for your money here and it have everything you could possibly need . right off the top i have to say that the room could use a little freshening - - some updating to the bathroom , some new carpeting , and some new furniture . but , that be say , two good size bed ( note to hotel : buy some nicer mattress pad and fitted sheet so your guest don ' t strangle themselves at night ! ) ; tv be fine and remote have a sleep feature ; in room mini frig ( a must for me ! ) and free internet service that be strong with no interruption - - can ' t believe how many lower price hotels/ motel don ' t include this basic ! room also have microwave , nice table w/ chair , good air conditioning , lot of towel . the pool , right outside our door be large and very clean , also seem to be salt water instead of chlorine . plenty of nice , fresh , towel and lot of lounge and table/ chair set ups . nice spa that we didn ' t get to use because some group park themselves there and stay for the duration . also child ' s pool , playground , tiki hut area/ snack bar . the main building have a game room which be not of interest to me , child ' s activity ( ditto ) , a cafe with a nice breakfast and a food court which offer a snack menu ( burger , pizza ) , fountain drink , cold beer , other grocery , small drug store necessity - - could have use a nicer selection of magazine and newspaper that you didn ' t have to buy at the box outside . pool didn ' t close until 12 : 00 midnight which could be a problem if you go to sleep earlier a many of the guest tend to be loud . also the piped in music which be charm during the day be irritate when it continue all night . i didn ' t have to use the shuttle service so i can ' t comment although i can say that generally it can be an exhausting way to come and go , expecially with young child a there ' s a lot of wait involve ( on top of all the wait you ' ve do all day in the park ! ) location of this hotel be terrific . it ' s on `` tacky highway '' a i call it but whatever one could need be close by : shop , restaurant , theme dinner show , entrance to dwd resort , rte . 4 , grocery store , drug store , small little ride like `` fun spot , `` and `` old town. `` if you want luxury and 5 star accommodation , this isn ' t the spot for you . if you want a place to lay your head and dip in a nice pool at a great price , then try it . i hope you ' ll be pleasantly surprised , a i be .",1,571
"i feel almost guilty give this place 2 star because in all honesty , i didn ' t have the opportunity to check out all the amenity that give this place such high rating . i do book my stay here base on yelp review but because i be in town for work , i be out the door too early to enjoy the free breakfast and back too late to partake of the happy hour . i saw a couple of large dog hang around and a a pet owner , i can appreciate that . but here be where thing go wrong . . . the pool . half indoors , half outdoors , great concept ! problem be the pool be place on the wrong side of the building . face busy traffic and sit in shade due to the shadow of the building until nearly even . you will not get a tan here . there be also a problem with the air conditioning . the room would not cool below 76 degree . i need it just a few degree cooler in order to sleep comfortably . i wake up at 2 a. m. and kick the cover off . they offer to let me switch room but i didn ' t feel like do a bad drag at that time of the morning so i just ask them to take a look at it the next day . next night , still hot . i just dealt with it . next morning a i be leave for work at 5 a. m. , i ask if i could have a late check out because again i didn ' t feel like do a bag drag at that time of the morning . when i return to my room around 11am , the do not disturb sign be still on the door , but the door be open . i mean , deadbolt disengage , door obviously open , and not a staff member in sight ! nothing be take but i be pretty irritated . especially a i be get pack and the cleaning staff come knock . i have a late checkout at 1pm ! why be you knock ? and why be my door open ? ? ? there be a line at the front counter and i didn ' t feel like wait around to mention this to the front staff . i mean , what be they go to do anyway at this point ? the icing on the cake be the mold . okay , i don ' t know for sure that there be mold in the room but in addition to be hot the first night , i also wake up because i couldn ' t breathe . the congestion get worse the next day and my coworker tell me i should probably move to another hotel but again i figure , maybe it ' s not mold and one more night win ' t kill me . that be three day ago . i have a full blown upper respiratory infection now . which develop the first night in that room . i obviously can ' t prove it ' s mold but if you get stick in a room with a struggle ac and you feel congestion come on , get out !",0,568
"don ' t spend your precious time or money stay here . we be on our first ever disney vacation and we have read that the lake buena vista resort ( best western ) offer the best value for money . we arrive at the hotel and immediately notice it be a little tired look . much of the decor be stick in the 80 with a few modern- look piece throw in . our room be acceptable and tidy , although the cleaning that be do during the day while we be out be minimal . the staff be not helpful and motivate by what they could get out of you . we walk up to the guest service counter and inquire about what would be the best way to get to fort wilderness . the woman there look like they have never hear of it and say `` you ' d probably have to get a taxi '' and `` ask the valet staff outside. `` so , you ' re in guest service but we have to consult the valet over a simple question ? ? she then proceed to try to swindle u by offer u a complimentary breakfast at a `` brand new resort '' down the road and say that we would be give $ 75 to spend in the park . we quickly realize that this be just a sale pitch desk and there would be no chance of get any information out of her . since this experience , i read another yelp review from january 2011 detail the same exact encounter with guest service . i conclude , then , that the staff member be lie when she say the resort down the road be brand new . discourage by this experience , we decide to try to figure thing out alone , so we head to downtown disney , which be about a 15 minute walk from the hotel . a soon a we arrive , we notice a huge bus terminal with bus to pretty much every destination within disney world , include fort wilderness . how hard would it have be for the woman in guest service to provide u with this information ? we felt like maybe we should return and enlighten her . thanks for nothing . get to and from the disney park be pretty much a horrible experience . since this be our first trip , we have no idea what to expect . the shuttle be crowd and noisy and despite our hotel supposedly be `` on the park '' , it take up to 40 minute to arrive at our destination each day . come home be even worse , and the fact that the shuttle make stop at multiple hotel and park zap whatever energy we might have have leave after a long day of walk in the park . have to stand for a 40 minute bus ride surround by rude , sweaty vacationer and scream kid be not exactly my idea of `` the most magical place on earth '' and certainly diminish the fun of our trip . this hotel do not provide a shuttle to orlando airport , so we have to fork out $ 50+ each way on taxi ride - money we wish we could have put towards stay somewhere more convenient .",0,568
"simply put : don ' t stay here . expensive , dirty , nasty . . . we arrive very late ( 2am ) after a delayed flight . we go straight to our room ( we have 6 room in total for our group ) . my room smell awful ! but it be 2am and we opt to go to sleep and deal with it in the morning . the fridge smell like something have die in it . the room be so moldy and musty smelling . when we go to use the sink , there be hair scatter on top of the counter ( short men ' s hair and we be two long haired woman share a room ) . it be so gross . we stay one night in that room and ask to be move to another room the next evening . our second room ' s shower wouldn ' t drain so i have to call down to get that fix . if that wasn ' t bad enough , the next day one of our other room smell like something have die in it a well . i call down and they move the student we be travel with into another room . 2 of 6 room smell like mold and decay . stay somewhere else . before we arrive at the hotel , i call and speak at length with a hotel operator . she be very knowledgeable . i ask about internet use and gym use . she say we have free in room internet and free use of the gym . when we arrive the woman who we check in with say that we have nothing . i explain to her what the woman on the phone say and she say she could give u a small credit toward the internet use . we have 6 high school student with u who all need to study for final and work on project via the internet . i be piss off but it be 2am so i think i ' d pick the fight later . two day later i be at the front desk check on something with the room and the man i be work with tell me that of course internet be free a well a the gym , two bottle of water a day , etc . . . i be so mad . every person i speak to it be a new story . our student hadn ' t be use the internet because they didn ' t want to rack up bill . the staff at this hotel be not well train . stay somewhere else . positive ( why they be 2 star instead of 1 ) : very close proximity to epcot ( you can walk there or take the free water taxi ) , picabu restaurant be open 24/ 7 and you can get breakfast there in the morning quite quickly ( it ' s pricey but so be all of disney ) , comfortable bed . we get a conference rate of $ 178. oh my ! i would never pay that out of my own pocket to stay at this place . there be so many option in the area , don ' t waste your time on this place . stay somewhere else .",0,567
"about what you ' d expect from a heavily traveled airport hotel . a bit thin on the reception area ( 2 station , the line back up ) , and who the hell build a hotel with no elevator in the lobby ? have to walk into one of the back corner to find one . they give me an upgrade to a suite ( i guess that ' s what they could call it ) ( hey , stay 125+ night a year with any chain and they start recognize you ) , that actually be very nice - remind me of an embassy suit room - a modest kitchenette ( microwave , dorm room refrigerator ) , a small `` living room '' with couch , and a 32 inch ( or so ) tv that look like it really should be a fireplace ( wonder if there ' s a station for that . . . ? ) ( i haven ' t watch tv since 2001 ) and a separate large bedroom with king bed , toiletry area and separate tile bathroom . very nice shuttle service from the airport - they quote me 20 minute , the driver be there in 10- 12. the ride back be full of tip on the cheapest place to get gas before return my rental car , and on how to reserve a ride back to the airport . ( every 30 minute on the hour and half hour - be sure to reserve a seat ) the shuttle also will shuttle you to the numerous restaurant within a 2 mile radius of the hotel , but look at the list ( chik- fill- a , hooter , denny ' s - yum ! ) i think i ' ll just grab a bite at the bar . i may update this after that , but have eaten 3 hour ago on the flight i ' m think it ' s a late dinner tonight . updating and downgrade from 4 to 3 star base on the din experience i just suffer through downstairs . the `` restaurant '' be in the lobby - random point of ingres / egress . no clear process or approach - do you seat yourself ? wait to be seat ? grab a seat at the bar ? i ask ( seat yourself ) and be wait on about 10 minute later . be feel not too hungry so order an appetizer of calamari and rock shrimp with a caesar salad . 20 minute later i get them both . calamari and shrimp be heavily bread , greasy , stick together and overcook , serve over some sort of pepperoncini / jalapeno melange with a sickly mayonnaise base dressing . the caesar salad drench ( literally drip ) with a slick , fat free dress - practically inedible . back in the room hop i didn ' t get food poisoning . and all for $ 27 . 00 - a deal ! i ' ll skip on breakfast in the morning - hey , there ' s a denny ' s nearby right ? oh - big minus - there ' s no club , and they wouldn ' t comp me a breakfast even though i ' m ambassador level with them . go figure .",1,566

"the walt disney world swan & amp ; dolphin hotel be my favorite on- site walt disney world resort hotel , and the second- best deal overall for a wdw trip ( the 1st best deal be the downtown disney hilton , but it ' s miss some perk of the wdw swan & amp ; dolphin ) . the swan & amp ; dolphin be luxury hotel with the amenity of the 1st- party disney deluxe resort ( grand floridian , yacht club , etc ) but at a lower price . sure , the swan & amp ; dolphin be pricey , but , when you compare them to the rate of the disney deluxe resort , they ' re a bargain . the only disney perk you really miss out on be the free magical express shuttle from orlando airport , and you also can not use the disney dining plan . however , the swan & amp ; dolphin be one of only two 3rd- party hotel on the wdw resort ( the other be the downtown disney hilton ) that have extra magic hour a a perk . the amenity of the hotel when compare to a 1st- party disney deluxe resort be : ( 1 ) unique design and theme , ( 2 ) locate on the epcot resort lagoon , which include the boardwalk inn , yacht & amp ; beach club with boat to epcot and hollywood studio , and you can even walk into the `` secret '' epcot entrance locate in the world showcase , ( 3 ) fine din restaurant locate in- hotel , ( 4 ) deluxe pool , and ( 5 ) spa and fitness center . the advantage of the wdw swan & amp ; dolphin over 1st- party disney deluxe resort be : ( 1 ) price , be comparable to a disney moderate resort for deluxe amenity and location , ( 2 ) frankly the bed be 10x more comfortable ( you ' ll find pillow- top mattress with down comforter and down pillow ) . the disadvantage of the wdw swan & amp ; dolphin compare to 1st- party disney deluxe resort be : ( 1 ) no magical express shuttle , ( 2 ) no disney din plan . in my opinion , the pro far outweigh the con , and if you ' re look for a deluxe experience for a lower price ( and with more comfortable bed than any disney deluxe resort ) , book at the swan & amp ; dolphin . the difference between the two : dolphin be slightly le expensive and have an on- site 24/ 7 quick service store where you can buy sundries and snack . the swan be a bit more expensive and more luxurious in design . i personally prefer the dolphin for the advantage mention . note that the walt disney world swan & amp ; dolphin be own by starwood ; the dolphin be technically a sheraton resort and the swan be technically a westin . despite this , the dolphin have the westin style bed rather than sheraton ( though both be comfortable , luxurious bed ) . if you have starwood perk , they apply to these hotel . they have great discount especially for military , aaa and aarp .",1,564

"this hotel give me the worst customer service experience of my life . upon check in , the hotel staff member be rude and disinterested in help u , give more attention to her plate of nacho than to people check in . when we get to our room , we call the front desk for extra towel ( because four of u be stay in a double room ) and we be tell that we would have to come pick them up ourselves because housekeeping have go home for the day . it be early evening . the real coup de grace come the second day , however , when i ask for a replacement room key . at first the manager be overly accommodate , but when he ask to see my id i inform him that my name wasn ' t on the room . this be where the problem start . the day prior , the front desk accommodate early check- in for a friend of mine whose name be not on the reservation . when i inform this to the manager , he say that whoever have do so have make an error , and would be reprimand for his action . when i ask him again politely if he would be able to make an exception for me a well , he begin to yell at me , say i didn ' t understand their policy and that it be for my protection . he say that my friend would have to come sign me in , which wasn ' t possible since they be all still at a conference at the nearby convention center . when i be tell i would just have to wait , i become frustrated , and the manager begin yell at me further since i be no longer be nice to him . he treat our conversation like an interrogation , say that `` we could do this the easy way or the hard way '' , make a scene for onlooker in the lobby . when i begin call my friend one by one , he tell me to hang up . he say that he would be able to give me a new room key if i leave my id at the front desk . in my frustration , i say i didn ' t want to leave it with incompetent management and he once again restate the easy way / hard way expression . exhaust after just walk a mile in heel , i leave my id at the front desk , and he tell me that my friend could pick it up for me . however , when my friend go to pick up my id he say he couldn ' t give it to her because i make a `` big stink '' about everything . never before have i be treat so poorly by someone in the service industry . i can ' t believe i pay money to stay at this hotel . don ' t waste your time here . if you be look for an affordable hotel to stay near the convention center , stay at the best western plus on westwood . they be extremely nice , the hotel be squeaky clean , and they have free breakfast .",0,561
"if you be come to orlando expect a magical , fun fill vacation . . . avoid this hotel ! i unfortunately have to stay at this hotel because i attend a conference in orlando and this be one of the conference hotel . my coworkers and i have never experience such poor customer service and this really ruined our hotel experience . to be fair , there be some good point : 1. the hotel be very pretty and the pool be very nice . 2. their be good ( although expensive ) food option available , and the caribe royale be right across the street from a reasonably price mexican restaurant , pizza restaurant , chinese restaurant , 7- eleven , and cv pharmacy . 3. the room be spacious and there be a tv in both the bedroom and living room part of the room . 4. every room come with a refridgerator and microwave . now , on to the many bad point : 1. they overbooked themselves and have to send many people to a disney hotel for the night . this happen to one of my coworkers and it do not matter that we make the reservation month ago . they pay for the night at the disney hotel , but the front desk staff at the caribe royale be extremely non- caring and have a bad attitude regard the situation . i know that suck to have to tell people , but act like a snotty princess do not help . 2. we ask for non- smoking room and when we get to our room it they reaked of cigarrette smoke . we call the front desk to get new room and the front desk staff argue with u and insist that there be no way we could possibly be smell cigarette . eventually we be move , but i fee like it should not have take an agrument . 3. i buy an even pas to disney from the concierge at the front desk . when i go she be on her dinner break ( which be fine ) , but i be tell nobody else could sell me the ticket and that i would have to wait for her to get back . when i ask how long , i be repeatedly tell `` she should be back from now , i don ' t know. `` so , i end up stand there watch the staff avoid make eye contact with me . when the concierge finally return , she have an armful of subway sandwich that she then distrubted and get reimburse for by her coworkers before finally get me the ticket . 4. the return bus from disney be run almost an hour behind . when i call to inquire about the shuttle , nobody seem to know about anything that be happen . 5. the front desk staff act like we where bother them every time we ask a question . it be really awkward and it make u feel hesitant to approach them about anything . i would never never never stay at this hotel again . i would rather stay at a disney own and run property and take a cab to the convention center than deal with poor staff at the caribe royale .",0,560

"i will not stay here ever again ! first off , my hubby and i arrive at the hotel at about midnight after a long flight and take a shuttle to the wrong hampton inn ( my fault for not confirm the address with the driver ) , and upon arrive to the correct hotel we be give room key to a room that be already occupy and luckily our key do not work , but we wake up the poor occupant . we go back downstairs and the on- duty receptionist tell u that he do not check the first name on the reservation and just hand u room key . then , we finally get room key to an unoccupied room and go to sleep . then in the morning we come to find out that the toilet although clean be not flush properly and the sink water pressure be very low . so , we call the front desk and the same guy proceeds to ask u if we want to try unclog the toilet with a plunger . we amuse him and say , `` why not. `` he drop it off and doesn ' t stick around to see if we want to pack up and change room . guess what - - the plunger doesn ' t do a thing to fix the flush power . we call front desk back and tell them that we need a new room . we pack it up and go back downstairs to get a new room . he be nice enough to drop our rate down for the inconvenience . wait , there be more . . . we get a new room and all seem well for two night except that there be no parking and the hotel be definitely be remodel . on our last night there , we arrive back from visit universal studio and our room key doesn ' t work . i go back downstairs to the front desk to explain . this guy take my old key and say they be demagnetize ( hmm , my hubby and i kept be key separately - - how do they both get demagnetize ? ? ? ) , plus he doesn ' t even check my id and activate key to the room number i rattle off . luckily , our stuff be still in the room and nobody else be occupy our room ( two of our biggest fear ) . i would not stay here again and hotel management will be get a letter from me about our stay . this be by far the worst experience i have ever have at a hotel . i would rather stay at a comfort inn instead . sorry hampton , you have lose a customer for life and i will not stay at any of your hotel again . other con : complimentary wifi do not work on my tablet , but work on my husband pcbreakfast offering be okay , but not greattile on bathroom floor feel gross and slimy shower wall need to be replace a the plastic be crack and have lot of caulkingtile in reception area look very dirty . pro : clean bed , tv work , and water pressure in shower be good .",0,558
"i don ' t know why , but i expect a little more from fairfield since it be own by marriott . i think much of my opinion be in line with other yelpers here . the hotel do seem quite date , and the service be not super friendly . i feel like every encounter we have with front desk be below average in term of service . the last day we be check out , we have already request late check- out during our check in , and they say `` sure , the latest be 2pm '' , so we take it . of course after 12pm , our key no longer work . we go downstairs to clear up the mistake and they give u another key to get back into our room to pack up our stuff . the new key didn ' t work . . . and the key after that didn ' t work . . . . we go down 3 time before we get a key that would work/ open the door again . pretty annoy since we be on the top ( 5th ) floor too . the room itself be not super spacious , but it do have a fridge . our smell really funky when we open it so we avoid use it when possible . avg nightly rate obviously vary depend on the season that you go . during my 8 night stay there last week , the price be around $ 125 then drop to $ 98 on a few day . i be try to save money on the hotel during this trip , but consider what we get out of it , i wish i book the courtyard ( right next door ) instead . the service and staff be much nicer and the hotel look more updated , and cleaner . they do have a complimentary breakfast from 6 : 30- 9 : 30am . everyday be the same thing : scramble egg or hard boil egg , sausage patty , bagel , bread , 3 cereal option , yogurt , and some fruit . coffee , juice and milk also available . it ' s no bad if you don ' t care what you have for breakfast . there be one more when we be surprise they swap out the sausage patty for sausage gravy with biscuit . shuttle be available to the disney world park , free of charge . but the pick up time be limited . morning drop off be : 8am , 9 : 20 , 10 : 30 , or 12 : 30pm . leave the park to come back be 6pm , 7 : 30pm , 9 : 30pm , 11 : 30pm . additional hour will be give at the front desk if magic kingdom be open later that day . they also have shuttle service to universal studio , orlando for $ 13 per person . the shuttle leave that park at 7pm , so get there early if you can to see/ do everything you want to . if you ask me now , i would recommend staying/ check out the neighbor hotel courtyard which be also own by marriott if you want a more comfortable stay ,",0,557
"what a terrible experience ! i give this hotel one star only because i wasn ' t allow to submit the review with zero star . after see some review that say this be a great place to stay if you need a hotel just to sleep , i book the reservation online a few day before my night in orlando . my plan be to go to the disney park and then check in late at night , but something tell me i should confirm my reservation in person before head to the park . thankfully i do because despite have a reservation confirmation from the website , the hotel have zero record of my reservation . wolf ( the gentleman at the front desk ) be very nice and be able to do a last- minute reservation for that night . my original reservation be for a king- sized bed , and when i leave the hotel in the morning , i have a printed confirmation of a room with two double bed . however , when i arrive at the hotel around 1am , emily santiago ( the night shift employee at the front desk ) say the room we be set to be in be no good . she then say we could go in another room and if we have any problem , we should come back and she ' d fix it . i ask what kind of problem we ' d have , and she say it might not be clean . she have a hotel employee check to see if it have be clean , and while we be wait , i start look around the lobby . it be horrifically disgust and look like it hadn ' t be clean in year . the pool bathroom have no soap in either the men ' s or woman ' s room , so when i use it , i have to use hand sanitizer several time because of how grimy the place be . the room end up be clean , but when we go to go see it , it have only one full- size bed and a child- sized pull out couch . this be unacceptable for two full grow adult who be not in a relationship , so i cancel the reservation . while i be figure out the refund , emily keep call me `` honey '' and `` mami , `` which i have to tell her to stop do . she say that the manager be the only one authorize to issue refund , so i ' d have to come back or call in the morning . she also be unable to give me the manager ' s last name , which i thought be pretty sketchy . when i call the next day , wolf be at the front desk again , and even though the manager be unavailable , he be able to issue the refund . thankfully , it work out with the payment and me not have to sleep on the street that night ( which the bum outside the hotel probably have to do ) , but i would never stay at any howard johnson hotel ever again . they be untrustworthy and absolutely disgusting .",0,556
"just . . . . no . seriously run away . . . . i ' m not even go to tell a story , i ' m just go to list all the reason to not stay here . . . ever . whether it quality inn or wow resort orlando . just no . first off all of the staff be incredibly rude and un accommodating . nothing could be do about room without book agent or get thing sign off by others . at one point the front desk didnt even know what room be full and which be open ! one even a manager have to knock on door to see if people be in room or not to see which one be available after people be walk into occupy room . one room we have have no shower curtain or towel and the baseboard be be prop up with a trash can . the second room the door to the bathroom wouldn ' t shut and it look like someone have try to kick the door open previously by the look of the door frame . there be also a hole directly into our ac unit from outside . the third room have a leak from the ceiling that drip directly onto the toilet paper and then proceed to leak water out of the light socket by the sink ! the `` continental breakfast '' be only 2 cereal and bread . the staff would set out muffin 3- 4 at a time once an hour , you have to ask for one if you want one . the concierge be rude and unhelpful and could only call u a taxi . the shuttle if you can call them that didn ' t even run until the park close . they leave a few time in the morning , at i think 9 and then 10. and it come back at 8. that ' s it . one elevator be out of order but only have an out of order sign on the first floor . there be no do not disturb sign . the staff didnt know english hardly at all except when foreign people talk to them then they claim to not know their language and their english be impeccable ! there be zero fire extinguisher or fire hose . the men ' s restroom in the lobby by the pool be a pull door from the inside , but have no door knob so you have to hope someone heard you knock to be let out . the location might be nice but just don ' t trust it . they even have sign say only order from domino ' s because every pizza place be a scam that leave you flyer . god forbid something happen . it ' s off a busy street at have a car accident at one point and it take the cop 2 hour ! ! ! ! to respond to that let alone a problem at the hotel . i don ' t care if you , re use it to sleep in . so we ' re we and we wish we could have cancel our second night . no amount of location or cheapness be worth it !",0,555
"my husband and i just stay here and have a nice week . we be stay a guest of an owner , and therefore can ' t comment on the value , but we be very happy with the room . apparently , it be one of their remodel room . the bed be extremely comfortable , and the kitchen be well- equipped with very high- quality nonstick cookware . it be cold during our visit so we do not swim , but the heated pool look great and many kid be take advantage of them . overall , the landscaping of the place be lovely . wifi be free for up to two device per room . though slightly disappointing , i do find this fair . it work pretty well once we be hook up . the tv be large and have a great selection of cable . we didn ' t make it to any of the onsite restaurant except the pool happy hour , which we be the only attendee of . the margarita be tasty ! there be a few thing i find disappoint with our stay . one be the `` free shuttle '' to the park . we be plan two day at disney , and be excite to take advantage of this service . unfortunately , however , the earliest shuttle of the day leave at 10 : 30 , when park open at 9 : 00. with the price of disney ticket , there be no way i be go to waste that much of my day , so we end up drive . the shuttle service to universal seem to be more frequent , but i wouldn ' t count on it . proximity to the disney park be excellent ; just a quick , easy drive . another disappointment be that while we be check in , exhaust , at 10 : 00 pm , we get somewhat trick into attend a timeshare sale presentation . we be tell it be so we could `` learn more and recommend the resort to our friend , `` but no , it be just a straight- up sale presentation . now , we be treat politely by all three sale rep , and get out in under two hour , but get shuffle in like that on checkin put a weird taste in my mouth . i know many people be use to stay in timeshare property and may expect this . we do get our prize a promise ( a visa gift card ) . my final annoyance be that , on checkout morning , we get two unsolicited `` wakeup calls. `` checkout be early , 10 : 00 be , but a adult i prefer to let u handle make it out on time . you do need to leave the dishwasher on ( we just leave clean dish , which hopefully will be okay ) and use linen in the bathtub or risk a fine upon checkout . overall , none of the annoyance be enough to ruin my nice stay . if you ' ve read this and they all sound workable to you , this could be a great place to to stay affordably on your orlando trip .",1,554
"first of all , the big negative be my girlfriend and i both get horrible mite bite around our ankle after our first night here which go away after a day or two away from the hotel . some even get bloody . this be something that absolutely positively should never ever happen in a hotel but for it to happen at a well regard chain like radisson be something else . honestly , this be really outrageous . i suspect it will keep me from ever go back to a radisson . i ' ve stay at some pretty awful fleabag hotel in my career ( far worse than this ) but i ' ve never get bit by anything other than a mosquito . beyond that deal breaker issue the hotel might have earn more star if not for a few other issue . 1 ) the hotel be huge and hard to navigate - and the door be lock at night due to overactive security concern . we arrive exhaust at 2am and struggle to find the lobby and have to walk half way around the exterior of the hotel which really be sprawl . 2 ) we have a power outage during our stay ( right while i be try to deliver some document for work ) and be unable to get any information from the hotel about it despite be tell we would be update . during the blackout the emergency light require by the fire code show themselves poorly maintain . 2 out of 3 be out on our floor and another guest tell u all of his be out . i really , really , really would rather be in just about any other hotel during an emergency ! this be a major safety issue . 3 ) the place be understaffed give how many guest there be in the sprawling complex , at least at the front desk , and we consistently have to wait long stretch for help at the front desk . 4 ) this be an ongoing pet peeve with hotel but i pay for high speed internet advertise a 15mbps and get high speed internet that be 7mbps down and 1 . 6mbps up . they do refund this . 5 ) and finally they charge a $ 20 resort fee on top of the room fee . i don ' t mind pay $ 20 more , but i ' d rather it be include in the cost of the room , because a ) anything else be shady and dishonest and b ) then it would count towards my reward . 6 ) don ' t count on the shuttle to the park . they only leave once every two hour . the last hotel i stay in in orlando do something similar , but get you a black car and pay for it if you miss the shuttle . no such offer be make here . on the plus side , the room be nice apart from the mite and scabies , the pool look very , very nice , the location be convenient to the park and to celebration , there ' s a starbucks right next door and lot of din option at the hotel .",0,553
"i have now stay here on two separate occasion , both in the upscale room and the base room . for the price , this place really do have some nice amenity . be florida resident , they be offer up some great pricing around $ 99 a night , and it can really work out to be a nice `` staycation. `` the positive here really focus around some neat theming , and really nice pool area . the pool near the lobby be large , have a water slide , and pool bar . the bar be nice , offer a rather decent selection of beer outside the standard domestic stuff , and you can get a cup that allow you refill of soda while you be out there . on the other side of the hotel , you have the lazy river and another pool . the lazy river be nice , with different element to it like mist spray , water sprayer , and of course waterfall to get drench by . the onsite bowling ally be really neat , but super pricey . the first time i be here they have a special during the early daytime hour that make thing easier to afford , but that might be hit and miss . the gym onsite be theme very well with jack lalanne be the focus . the equipment be nice , and the space be rather large . one last positive here , your room key can be use just like a credit card all over universal property . it be really helpful to not have to carry your wallet or purse around everywhere . a for the downside here , there be no boat to get to universal studio , you have to use the bus . although it be rather prompt , it be a slight annoyance . the food on sight be really just average , and a bit expensive . do yourself a favor there and go offsite , you will find many more option and better pricing . the other huge negative here for me be the ridiculous wait time to check in or out of your room . there just have to be a better way here , and they have not figure it out . the line take 40 minute each time , and there just didn ' t seem to be any urgency by the staff to move the line along . too much confusion , and a lack of a quick check out be what seem to be happen here . now , for the tip to enjoy your time the most here . 1. they don ' t have enough space in their stand by park lot when you be try to check in at the 40 minute line . do yourself a favor , go immediately to your right in the parking lot for the hotel when you come in . take a ticket , park your car , and avoid sit in a long line of car try to find space . 2. bring your own inner tube if you can , they charge for them on property . if you ask nice , they will blow them up for you for free .",1,552
pro : breakfast be good everydaycons : we stay at this hotel for our trip to disney . we check in on sunday march 13th . monday we spend most of the day at disney . when we return to our room at 4 : 30 pm the door be open . of course we panic because we have be go since 8 : 00 be . i immediately call front desk to tell them what be go on . they say they would send someone up asap . in the mean time we be make sure all of our belonging we account for . nothing be miss accept our piece of mind . we have only be there one night and already there ' s a problem . so `` security '' come to our room and he have some sort of device and he ' s tell u that the house keep swipe in at 11 : 00. ok so our room door be leave open from 11 : 00am until 4 : 30pm ! ! ! he tell u she be the only one who come in . but how can you be sure when in order to tell if someone come in they need to use the room key . our door be open so there ' s no tell if someone actually come in after she leave our door open . also there be no camera in the hall where our room be to see if someone come in . after talk to numerous manger they offer to switch our room . switch our room wouldn ' t ensure house keep would close our door on the way out . when it be all say and do they give u dinner voucher . the shower be slow at drain so you basically take a shower and a bath at the same time . the toilet be also problematic . it would just barely flush and have to push the lever down more than once . also when we first check in there be no towel or wash rag in the bathroom . we have to call down to have some bring up . actually we have to call down at least 3 out of the 7 day we stay there because housekeep didn ' t give u fresh towel or wash rag . it be clear that they have come in because the bed be make . also if you want your sheet change there be a sign that you be to place on the bed let housekeep know you want your sheet change . house keep didn ' t change the sheet and we know because we would leave a little bit of juice on the sheet so we could tell . all in all when you go on vacation you want to stay at a place where you feel relaxed and safe and know that the people that work there be competent . house keep just be too much of a problem for u and we be constantly call front desk for basic necessity . we weren ' t ask for anything that wasn ' t a standard for our room . so no i would not stay here again of recommend this hotel .,0,552
"my experience start out on the wrong foot almost immediately . after arrive late in the evening ( around 11 : 45 ) i call for the shuttle . kevin give me instruction and i head that way . or so i thought . he forget to mention that there be two side ( a and b ) to this airport . . . for people that have never be there that be a very important point ! i finally get to the spot and wait . and wait . and call the hotel again only to find out the driver leave me there . kevin have the nerve to get all rude with me about not be at the spot quick enough and say he ' d call the driver back . whatevs . check in be fine . he be fairly friendly and quick enough . i go to the room and be take aback - it smell pretty mildew when i walk in . consider this be florida , that be a bit expect . however , what be not expect be how very date this place be . seriously - hotel listen up ! it ' s 2- 0- 1- 3 ! ! ! ! ! if you still have wall- mount air conditioner , you - a my ti would say- be wrong ! the paint be horrid , the shower look like something out of the 70 , and thing be , in general , pretty gross . on the plus side , we be only there to sleep , shower and eat breakfast . haha - we achieve most of those . breakfast - if you can call it that - leave a whole lot to be desire . there be some bread and bagel , activia yogurt , some crappy pastry , cereal with 2 % milk ( only ) , some sausage and egg that look disturbing , and some fruit that look a though the local basketball team use it to practice . oh - and that be limit to orange and apple . even the coffee look terrible - it literally look muddy . . . i ' m not even exaggerate that . good deal for waffle house next door . . . service be so- so . kevin be friendly . he also have a lot to deal with - by himself ! give that poor kid some help already ! we didn ' t get our room clean on the second day of our stay for some odd reason and have to get our own fresh towel from the desk . we get lock out of our room ( key stop work ) and the vending machine jack my water and money ! the one thing that really irk u be the parking . there wasn ' t even close to enough place for everyone to park . we have to , after fight cramp space fill with other driver do the same , go to the parking lot at the waffle house next door . overall , we be not happy with this place . the bed be comfy but that be about it . we ' ll be stay elsewhere next time . . .",0,551
"let me first clarify that the only reason i stay here be because i have an amazing coupon from orbitz that make this place only $ 18/ night after the discount . how could i resist that ? you can ' t even stay at a dirty hooker motel with bedbug for that . by the way , i wouldn ' t pay more than $ 18 + $ 7 . 99 resort fee for this place . the 1 star i give this place be for the cheap cheap orbitz price and the view of the nightly fireworks from both magic kingdom and epcot . the room be fine , tidy . housekeeping always forget to leave u bath towel so we have to constantly call down to the front desk and request them . the bed leave my lower back ache every morning . the tv only offer basic cable . the wall be thin . i want to have a bubble bath , but there be this gross bath mat that be affix to the tub and when i try to lift it up there be all this gooey stuff ( glue ? ) underneath . there be construction go on also so i have to listen to a constant banging . the staff weren ' t very polite . when i check in , the front desk staff didn ' t even speak a word of welcome . housekeep staff use the regular elevator and literally run me over with a laundry cart and pin me up against the wall . i let out a yelp , no pun intend , and didn ' t even receive an apology . the business center be a big scam and eat $ 5 . 00 that i put in the computer and didn ' t even print what i want it to . when i look for a remedy , there wasn ' t one . she tell me to use the `` help- line '' where it just rang and rang and rang . eventually i have use the computer at the front desk . again , no apology and i never get my $ 5 . 00 back . the resort fee be suppose to include a daily newspaper which i never get . and when i call down to request newspaper service , they tell me to come down in the morning and grab one before they run out . wtf ? the `` guest service '' counter , that ' s another story . by `` guest service '' they mean `` aggressive time share sale '' and you can not get straight answer or information about area attraction without be swindle into give your information to them and be heckle into attend a complimentary breakfast to learn about wyndham at bonnet creek . talk about annoy . i can ' t wait to get that junk mail . jesus . i ' m only halfway through my stay and i already felt compel to write this review just in case i can save someone an unpleasant stay . there be so many hotel in the area that offer a much much better experience . contact me for recommendation and avoid this hell hole .",0,551
"the good the bad and the ugly . . the good , it ' s a residence inn ( so no need to explain to me that there ' s a full compliment of stuff in the kitchen ( duh ) ) , it ' s along side an area that be be develop , that ' s a good thing to me , along with high end apartment , retail store etc . . the good , the employee be care and somewhat helpful . the bad , the employee which be tear between a loss of identity . when you enter the main entrance you don ' t know if you go leave or right for your hotel since the r. i. be on the right and the courtyard hotel be on the left . you don ' t have to decide a they work together but it make for an awkward time for a bit , especially if you ' re a frequent marriott traveler , you kinda be use to direction and signage . the bad ( yes there be more ) be you over care employee that tell you to much personal information about other employee on a shuttle ride to a restaurant about 4 mile away . the bad , be be leave for 1 plus hour and neglect after ask for a pick up from a location after say lunch . the bad , be be talk to like you ' re an infant and an as from the mod ( manager on duty ) who just 3 hour before be your shuttle driver that drive you to the restaurant . the bad , be be leave to find a ride back and show back up to the hotel 2 hour after you make a phone call to be pick up ( yes i have phone call log with time ) . the bad , if you think it ' s close to the airport because they provide a shuttle , think again . it ' s not . the bad . . . i think that ' s enough for tonight . . the ugly ? the ugly be the condescend attitude when you leave the place all upset where the employee be so well trained they say `` thank you have a good night '' when they know damn well you ' ve have a crappy one because of them . since i can ' t leave it on a bad not . . this be an a- ok hotel border on a 5 star woo hoo a good a it get hotel . it ' s clean , new and have management in place that be willing to listen , educate his employee and learn from the mistake and want to make it better . that ' s what make a leader and the gm be an experienced man that can pull it off . with the tennis center open shortly , this hotel will be a destination hotel vs a `` let ' s check it out and have a staycation '' place . they have some bump in the road to work out but i have no doubt that i ' ll return someday .",0,547
"this be an amazing location . while research for possible place to stay i have two thing to consider : 1. would i rather have a shuttle available to take me to the airport ? or2 . would i prefer to have free shuttle service to the theme park for the duration of my stay . a you may have already guess , i choose the latter . i believe that you save a lot of time , gas and money when you choose this option . a you win ' t have to worry about parking and get out of the park and valet , etc . i also prefer this location because it be truly very close to universal studio . technically , i could have jog there , but who want to do that in 90+ degree weather ? in addition to the free shuttle service , this hotel offer free continental breakfast for the duration of your stay . the food offer be delicious and the same that ' s typically serve at every holiday inn ( egg , biscuit , gravy , breakfast sausage and link , pancake , toast , cereal , etc. ) . the food be always fresh and promptly serve at 6 : 00 a. m. - 11 : 00 a. m. they also offer late night pancake . yep , you can enjoy pancake at 10 : 00 p. m. if you ' d like . a standard room be a bit cozy , but my two other roommate sleep comfortably on the queen size bed . the room we have overlook the city and so we be able to see the firework from universal right from our room . this didn ' t deter u from view it up close . i didn ' t have a chance to use the pool , but what i ' ve find even more awesome be that they have laundry facility on two floor in addition to vend machine for snack and drink . they be of course overprice , but still very convenient . there be additional guest service up front across from check- in where you will need to obtain shuttle pass for the day you wish to take the bus to the park , so be sure to get those . you can get on the bus at any time , but you will need to get a pas . guest service can also assist with purchase additional ticket and information about the park . they be usually there pretty late at night , so if you have any question , be sure to ask either of them . lastly , the location of this holiday inn be within walk distance of several restaurant such a carrabba ' s , golden corale , burger king , wendy ' s and so much more . forewarning , a cab ride from the airport to the hotel will cost $ 57 . 00 , a it be a 20 minute drive . the cab driver also add tip to the fare automatically and unfortunately , uber be not allow at the airport . i highly recommend this hotel for your next vacation at universal orlando .",1,545
"we spend 4 night here while visit disney world and it be . . . well . . . interesting . we book a 2 queen on expedia ( 1 king be not available ) for $ 40 per night . we be look for a bare bone hotel to help save some money on the trip , so go into the reservation expect very little . we get even le . we check in and be tell how to get to our second floor room . head back to the room we realize that they have not put u in the tower show on the expedia site but the old run down motel section of the hotel behind the tower . walk to our room it seem they have a huge and very loud convention go on . all the down stair room be open with large group of people hang out listen to music . after we walk a way to get to our back lot room we find out that there be no elevator . i don ' t typically have a problem take the stair but a we have just get back from a cruise and have 2 week worth of luggage i wasn ' t please . one of the security guard on the premise help u get the luggage upstairs . at this point my opinion be already taint . we get to the room at it reek of mold , you can literally see where moisture have drip down the wall and be paint over . the bathtub have lose it finish and the carpet be dirty enough to make my foot start itch . deep breath , $ 40/ night let ' s try and deal with it . after go out to get lunch we come back and try and log onto the advertised free wi- fi to check email and watch online show . no wi- fi available . at this point i ' m do and call the front desk to complain and ask why the experience be so different than advertise . they tell me that the convention be everywhere and that they think i will be able to hear it anywhere they put me outside the tower . they also tell me wi- fi be only available in the tower . after a long talk the woman at the front desk let ' s me know that if we pay an extra $ 16 per night we can be move to the tower . for our health and sanity we pay the upgrade . the tower room be update , clean and overall pretty great . hence 2 star instead of 1. so then we be feel better about the room . we then decide to eat in the restaurant one night and both end up sick to our stomach . have the disney shuttle in the morning be nice but a it only have one 2 pick up time very late at night it wasn ' t all that helpful . we pay for cab back to the hotel 2 out of three night we be at the park . i would never stay here again . end of story .",0,545
"i be very disappointed with this hotel . i have stay here a numerous amount of time before and i have no problem with it , until now . first off , i have do the online check in , and state there that early check in be a must for me because of the fact that my train get to kissimmee at 12 : 30 so i didn ' t want to wait till 3 for a room . and they say they ' ll try their hardest to get me the room early . i arrive to the hotel at around 1 : 45 , and my room be not ready so they say to come back in an hour . so i decide to take a look around the resort , eat some lunch . come back at 2 : 50. and they say the room be still not ready . the man at the front desk saw the frustration in my face and immediately call housekeeping to see if there be any room available for me . . because it be already 3 o ' clock and i want to get to mickey ' s not so scary halloween party at exactly 4. so they assign me to a room , but i feel like this room be probably the worst room i have ever see ! we get there , and the carpet be soak wet ! but we didn ' t pay too much attention to it , i be like okay whatever , we get dress and leave for the park . when we come back to the hotel at night . we decide to turn the temperature of the room up by 2 degree , instead of 70 , just put it to 72 , so that when we get out of the shower , we ' re not shake like wet little dog . the minute i change the temperature , my boyfriend and i instantly smell something burning ! the a/ c be let off a burning smell . so we put it back to 70 degree . and on our last day there , i be furious , the housekeeping people knock three different time on the door , wake u up from our sleep three different time ! ! ! we have request late check out ; which be grant to u ! ! ! ! and this lady knock at 8 : 20 in the morning ! ! ! i open the door , and she walk away without say a word . then the same lady come back at 10 : 30 ! ! and she ask what time i be leave i say 1 because we get extend check out . i be already aggravate because she could ' ve ask that the first time she knock ! but whatever i blow it off , and we go back to bed . then at 11 : 30 ! ! ! ! the same lady come back to ask the same question ! ! ! ! ! ugh , i be so annoyed . never again will i stay at this resort . i ' m very disappointed with it .",0,545
"we stay here during a visit to disney . we be originally book at the hotel in maitland , but after we realize how far it be from disney , we decide ( via hhonors gold ) to rebook at the int ' l. drive address . keep in mind , this stay be during a crowded time ( december , winter break to new year ) . hotel location- hotel itself be very good . spacious park lot , just about sufficient for the holiday season , a 6 out of 10 day we find a spot which be right outside our fourth floor window . clean outdoors , and good location on int ' l drive close to some restaurant ( which i personally don ' t like because they ' re touristy ) . it ' s practically next door to sea world , and close to a lot of orlando action . it ' s relatively close to disney and next to i- 5. plus , it ' s centrally locate between orlando ' s theme park and the airport , make it an ideal location for most park- goer . rooms- spacious , and fairly clean . when we be there , they give u a complimentary bag of m & amp ; m ' s and dasani . not a good a some other homewood suite location in term of cleanliness ; particularly because the sheet be change about every two day ( which i ' m cool with , but my folk weren ' t very happy with ) . i bet this be because the hotel be pretty occupied , and perhaps they couldn ' t change all of the sheet every day ( again , keep in mind holiday season ) . bathroom and supply be fully stock and clean . nice ac system that be easy to operate and comfortable . window open to let in fresh air ( a hilton trademark which i love ) . lobby and dining room be kept clean . they do have an official universal/ sea world special desk in the lobby which provide info and ticket . although we didn ' t go there , people do frequent it and they seem helpful . if we want to , we could have buy ticket at a bundle price , add to convenience . breakfast- ah , the ubiquitous homewood suite breakfast . i think they ' re pretty damn good , and this one offer a good selection if hot and fresh food . however , i have to admit that it be a royal pain to find a seat in the dining room , a it be pack and noisy . the food be standard fare , but also include a fresh belgian waffle maker , which i frequent for the first few day before get tire of continental breakfast food . a good pick if you ' re go to any of the orlando theme park . overall , i ' d give it a 3 . 5 out of 4 , but i ' ll give it the benefit of a 4 for the m & amp ; m ' s : ) .",1,544

"since my original review , i have stay at this hotel multiple subsequent time . i love it proximity to universal studio and to i4 . it ' s a very convenient hotel . usually when i travel , it ' s just me . i don ' t require a lot from a hotel and their staff , but i do like my room to be clean . since my original review the cleanliness have improve considerably in the hotel . the furnishing in the room be a bit worn , but for the price , i can deal with that . i don ' t expect them to put in new fixture every other month , or just because i be visit . there be still some bad , and that bad be the staff . every time i check in the staff seem oblivious and doesn ' t seem to care . a an elite member of carlson club , it would be nice if they recognize me a such . i shouldn ' t have to remind them , and i shouldn ' t have to remind them that i get a free room upgrade . sadly , i always have to remind them and i get the deer in the headlight look . when i check in , this be really the only time i will interact with the hotel staff - i be a really easy guest to have , i don ' t complain , i don ' t make a mess , and i don ' t make any demand . i check in , go to my room , and then go to the park and come back . all i want be my room upgrade without have to ask for it . another issue be park - they get bus and occasionally large construction vehicle . these people eat up multiple park spot . put bus and bigger vehicle elsewhere . also have to display the parking pas be a pain in the butt . i usually park , pull my bag out and check in . here i have to run back out to my car to put the pas on the dashboard . it ' s minor , but it bother me . other thing i like about this hotel be the gift shop . it be like a nyc bodega but nicer . they have a good assortment of snack and drink , and they keep the soda very cold . the lady behind the counter be awesome . very friendly . breakfast at the hotel be good , but i usually avoid it because it be pack with the rest of the vulture . cooky be usually at the front counter and be good . like i say , for the money , you can ' t beat the location and what you get . they still have a few thing to work on , but they will get there . if they do one thing , it would be to hire a more engaged front staff , and train them on how to properly take care of customer and make them feel welcome .",0,539
"be here on my honeymoon , and i rather enjoy this place . the pro : a you would expect from disney , all the staff be extremely nice and helpful . the scenery , decor , landscape , everything be beautiful and clean . for the price , you really can ' t go wrong with this place . centrally locate , so all the park , dtd ( downtown disney ) , and the boardwalk be all relatively accessible and be a somewhat short bus/ ferry ride . the room be nice , a little on the kiddy side with the nemo wallpaper and what not , but hey , you ' re at wdw . what i love most about this place be that you actually feel like you ' re at a caribbean resort . they have beautiful white sand beach where you can relax , get a tan , or chill with a beer in any of the numerous hammock that they have place through out the ground . the con : again , a you would expect with disney , the kid ! ! i realize this matter be purely subjective , but my god there be a shit ton of kid . . . everywhere . . . run . . . scream . . . cry , it never stop . next up be the actual layout of the resort . if you haven ' t do your research , you ' re in for a surprise . the room be break up into section of building with different name of caribbean island . we stay at jamaica , which be probably one of the better location . this matter because everything be sooo spread out which be kind of a plus and a minus . you just walk around the animal kingdom for 8- 9 hour and now you have to walk another 1/ 4 to 1/ 2 mile ( or more ) just to get to your room , especially if you miss your bus stop and have to backtrack ( believe me , it happen ) . which bring me to my next con . the transportation . because each `` island '' have it ' s own bus stop , you have to stop at every single island on your way in or on way out , which can be pretty time consume see a how there be 8 different island . lastly , the food situation , or lack there of . the food court be really quite a joke . again , disney , overprice cafeteria food for the most part with little selection and the inability to substitute certain item unless of course you have some kind of allergy ( nut ) , in which case they be very accommodate . all in all i really do like this place and would most likely go back for our next trip to wdw . i just couldn ' t give it more than 3 star a my con certainly out weigh the pro . but a i say above , for the price and location you really can ' t go wrong .",0,537
"my girlfriend and i take a little ' staycation ' for my sister ' s bachelorette weekend and we stay at the hard rock hotel . we have stay in the royal pacific hotel last year for another friend ' s bachelorette so we want to change it up a bit . the check- in be a bit crazy in that there be a long , slow move line . this be to be expect from a hotel in that area , and particularly right around check- in time , so it be not a problem . we have two room but a soon a we get in the first room ( dubbed our ' party room ' ) we realize that we could have probably all stay in one room . we get the 2 queen bed option , plus the room have a couch ( which i imagine be a pull- out bed a well ) . we sleep two in a bed comfortably , so we probably could have fit 5- 6 girl in one room . here be my big highlight : - apparently you can have an electric guitar send up to your room ( with a refundable deposit ) and we take full advantage of this ! this be a true pro- tip since they don ' t advertise it ( we only know because one of the girlfriend work for hard rock corporate ) . - the room be huge and very well decorate ! - want to watch movie but avoid the pay- per- view fee ? request a dvd player to be send up to your room ! we do this and get to watch a bunch of girly movie ( not porn . . . . ! ) here be the ~ eh~ moment : - the fitted sheet that cover the mattress be actually just a regular sheet tuck in . . . i don ' t know if it ' s just me , but it kind of freak me out when one of the girl inadvertently sleep under that sheet - directly on the mattress cover which have a stain or two . . . - we couldn ' t get the dvd player to work and after call the desk to get someone to help u ( the operator wasn ' t the most pleasant ) , the guy come and immediately make it work . when we ask how he do it ( since we ' d spend almost 30 min try to get it to work ) he say that you have to turn the tv to channel 90. . . . this would have be great to know prior to spend a bunch of time try to make the damn thing work . i ' d suggest that they get a label- maker and put that on the dvd player ! ~ grrr~ overall , we have a blast ! the facility be awesome , it have a boat that take you directly to universal , and the electric guitar be a total treat ( we get some ridiculous picture of u jam out in our jammies ! ) .",1,537

"the wife and i have become serious disney dork over the last few year . we have our annual pass , and try to make a visit down to disney world at least once every two month . once we find out how much better it be to stay at a disney resort than a standard local hotel , we ' ve try multiple disney resort to find our favorite . this be our first stay at caribbean beach- and we have a great stay , however it wasn ' t nearly on par with our favorite at port orleans . check in here be incredibly easy- the staff polite and helpful . be prepared however , a this resort be huge . surround a humongous lake- there be multiple building which be nice because they do offer some privacy , however if you get stick in a building away from the main pool / bar / din area- be prepare for a walk . we immediately hit a snag upon reach our room- even though i reserve a room with a king size bed , we be give a room with two twin . a call to the front desk reveal that the other room be book for the evening , so the wife and i bite the bullet . aside from that- the room be great . fridge be cold , a/ c work , room be stock with flatscreen tv , safe , coffee maker , iron board and iron , the bathroom be clean , and i love the double sink in the bathroom area- plenty of room to get ready . you can request a pirate theme room , or you end up with a nemo- themed room ( which we received. ) there be a lot of beach spread out near all the building along the lakefront- fill with play area for the kiddy , beach chair , and hammock . there ' s a running trail through the middle of the resort , and a always- lot of bus stop to pick you up and take you to whatever disney park or resort you want to go to- one of the highlight of stay at a disney resort . the food court be pretty impressive- lot of different choice for both breakfast and lunch/ dinner . the pizza place always cook up good pizza which be fairly cheap and great to save for late night snack . the pool area be very impressive , and the poolside bar a great place to grab some adult beverage and unwind . they also have an impressive gift shop and video game arcade in the main food court building . overall- i do have a great time here , although i enjoy some of the other moderate resort much more . this resort be much more expensive , and although my room be comfortable , and every staff member i encounter ultra- friendly , i would recommend stay at one of the other resort over this one . however , this be still light year above stay at another non- disney resort in the area .",1,530
"this be my third disney trip stay at the swan/ dolphin sister hotel , and this one be far superior to my last trip in a couple of way . the reason why my family ' s stay be excellent this time can be explain by the following reason : 1 ) revamp room ( swan only ) - within the last year or so the swan hotel ( westin property ) have make huge renovation to the room with new color scheme , furniture , and plasma screen tv . the bathroom also have the rectangle basin sink and walk- in shower with a rainfall nozzle . plenty of room in a standard king with great view of hollywood studio and tower of terror ( if you be face away from the crescent lake/ boardwalk view ) . it be also pretty quiet on the top floor . i can ' t speak to the dolphin room a i haven ' t stayed there in several year but i understand that they be undergo similar change . we also have free wifi with our stay package . 2 ) customer service - everyone at the front desk and bell boy service be extremely friendly . even though it be not a disney- run hotel , westin staff carry on a similar top notch quality . when we have an issue of a charge make to our room of $ 6 for something we never order , they take care of it for u with no question ask . 3 ) location - if you be an adult and you prefer the epcot/ hollywood studio park , this be the best place to stay besides boardwalk and yacht club . you be within walk distance of both park ( 10 min each way ) or an easy 5- 10 min ferry ride , all of which be free ! also bonus point for be a bridge away from the dining and entertainment option at the boardwalk . depend up your room location , you might also be able to watch the illumination or star war fireworks show without venture into the park . 4 ) price/ cost : disney vacation will put a damper on the wallet but if you be a starwood point holder and/ or have aaa membership , you can get solid deal on swan room , especially at non- peak season . the quality and size of the room be way better than what i have experience at the boardwalk inn and yacht club hotel at a reduced price . the only reason i give swan + dolphin le than 5 star be for the bus wait for magic kingdom , animal kingdom , and disney spring . you have to share the bus with the other epcot area hotel which can get packed very quickly and it take forever to get to ak and disney spring . if you plan on spending more time at magic kingdom , i would suggest wilderness lodge , contemporary hotel , and the polynesian if you want to stay on disney property out of convenience .",1,527
"stay at the point orlando resort during a 4 . 5 day vacation with the boyfriend in december 2015. we would totally stay here again and frequently talk about when we can visit again . this will be our go- to orlando accommodation in the future . here ' s why . 1 ) affordability : have a high- level pool- view one bedroom suite room with full kitchen , get a special by book a certain amount of time in advance that also come with a gift card and pay for our grocery for the week so we could eat a few meal at the hotel before hit the parks2 ) location : excellent location with minimal fare uber/ lyft ride to universal . even disney wasn ' t that badly price . right near international drive for restaurant and grocery ( although we didn ' t make it to a restaurant once ) . 3 ) amenity : pool and hot tub be clean - we enjoy both . poolside bar . this be hit or miss - the first couple of night the bartender be great . unfortunately the menu feature specialty cocktail that look nothing like what we order and state they come with a collector glass with the * high* price of the cocktail - instead they come in a plastic cub for the same price . the second to last night the bartender be different and be frankly quite rude . we be hop to watch a sporting event ( rather than the hgtv or whatever channel be on ) and she rudely state she `` didn ' t usually work here and we could figure out the remote ourselves '' . so we promptly do not give her a penny , go up to the room and watch the game on our tv and relaxed in peace with our own wine we get with the gift card ( see above ) . otherwise the staff be friendly and accommodate . 4 ) room : when we walk in the bed be full of kiss , towel swan and rise petal . this be our first trip together and make it extra special ( for me , anyway ) . the pool view be gorgeous to wake up to . we also enjoy order pizza and drinking wine on the balcony with the pool view after a long day at the park . the kitchen be a full kitchen - it literally have everything my apartment have . the bathroom be large with a jet tub ( we didn ' t use this , go down to the hot tub instead ) and walk- in shower with extra room for the toilet . fresh towel and freshly make bed every morning . the room be exquisitely clean . the only negative thing i can think to say be about the rude bartender and the lack of free continental breakfast , which many hotel in the area do include and would make the cost even more affordable . can ' t wait to visit the point again ! !",1,524

"let me start off by make this statement . the two star rating be compare this disney resort with the other resort on the wdw property . i have stay at the dvc villa at the wilderness lodge ( 2x ) , the polynesian , saratoga spring ( 2x ) , port orleans french quarter and old key west . this be a very nice place to stay but i would much rather stay at one of the other wdw resort . to start off the room be very small compare to the other disney resort . i have stay in moderate resort ( port orleans ) that have a bigger room than bay lake tower studio accommodation . it be very tight for 4 people to stay in the room . when i stay here i spend the first half of my stay at bay lake and the second half at saratoga spring . i be so happy to check into saratoga spring and be able to spread out and relax . at bay lake there be a security gate at pool so you have to use your key to access the pool and you need security to let you access the observation deck . i guess i can understand the security at the observation deck but at the pool ? this be the only resort that require you to use your room key to access the pool . the only perk for stay at this resort be access to the monorail . however because you be the first stop after the mk you have to board the monorail and make three stop before you get to the mk . if you be head to epcot you need to make the transfer at the transportation center . so it not that much of a perk . if you stay at the wilderness lodge you have an express boat ride to the mk that be exclusive to the wilderness lodge guest . a for watch the firework from the bay lake observation deck , you be better off go to the mk and ask the cast member of the astro- orbiter to let you up watch the firework from there . my 8 year old have a difficult time watch the firework from the observation deck because the railing be too high . i have some issue with the cast member at the contemporary but nothing extraordinary that i would get into detail in this review but i know would never happen at another wdw resort . maybe if i take a trip without the kid and be able to reserve one bedroom accommodation i would consider bay lake tower but for now i would prefer to stay at wilderness lodge and lay on the beach and watch the light parade on the water or play 18 hole at saratoga spring . if you be not a dvc member and would like to know more just send me message and i can let you in on disney ' s best kept secret .",0,513

"excruciate to the say the least . we stay 6 night and get the hotel by bid on a 3 star hotel at priceline . the hotel charge a `` serivce fee '' that total an additional 15 % over what we bid for the hotel . what be even more distressing be that we point out to the staff that they do not disclose this on their web site , in fact they advertise free parking and free internet , but in fact they charge you for it though the undisclosed `` service fee '' . so they be liars up front . the problem be that it isn ' t a 3 star hotel . it be maybe 2 1/ 2 if everything be perfect but everything be not . the room be clean for the most part , i have no complaint about that . the issue really be with the staff . on friday night during our trip 5 bus load of teenager show up . so you can imagine it get completely out of control . we ask to be move to a different room because they have u surround on all side . the hotel refuse to move u . then at 11 pm after the hotel curfew for teenager have pass i ask to be move again . they say they would send security to quit down the teenager but they do no such thing . for the next hour all of the adjacent room be leave open and the kid be wonder in and out of room with loud blast music and teen run up and down the corridor yelling at the top of their lung . at midnight i go down and demand to be move again . finally the hotel relent and move u to a quieter part of the hotel . unfortunately the problem be that the room that they move u to be occupy , so we walk in on someone asleep in their bed . that be a very uncomfortable situation . i go back to the front desk to let them know in no uncertain term that it be completely unacceptable to make a mistake where you be give me access to someone else ' s room or to give someone else access to my room . the staff be completely unapologetic for their mistake . they do send me to yet another room , but basically their attitude be why don ' t i just leave if i do not like it . i ask for a refund of the unused night but they refuse . the new room wasn ' t much better than the one we leave . it be directly adjacent to the pool and be much smaller than the first room . the hotel let the kid run around the pool until midnight make ton of noise . we didn ' t get much sleep for 2 day . the bottom line be i can not imagine ever stay there again .",0,511

"for the price and the location , this hotel be a great deal . the noise from i- 4 outside the window be loud but bearable , the bed be heavenly , and the flatscreen and free wi- fi be awesome . the room service be a hot mess though and need some serious help . first , we have to place an order around 10 : 30pm because we didn ' t have time for dinner and have an insane toddler bounce off the bed , keep u from blissful sleep . the person answer be disdainful and rude , maybe because it be half an hour from the kitchen closing but if you say room service be available until 11 , i should be able to order at 10 : 58 and still receive a courteous response . next , we order crab cake and a 30 dollar steak . two minute after hang up the phone we get a call back to say they be out of crab cake . no problem , i understand be out of something , especially that late at night . . . but that be just the beginning of their menu woe a i soon find out the next day . the food arrive quickly and turn out to be ok. the steak be more rare than medium rare and the asparagus barely seem to be cook . maybe they be just in a rush to close the kitchen . . . who know . call back at 11 : 04 to have the tray remove and receive no answer , so we place it in the hallway , which i hate to do because that ' s tacky . the next morning we order breakfast : corn beef hash with poached egg , smoke salmon bagel , and seasonal fruit and berry . again , two minute later i get a call to say they no longer carry corn beef hash and they be out of salmon because the fish truck hadn ' t arrive yet . ooookkkkkk . . . tell them i ' d call back in a few after i figure out what to order . call back and order the `` sticky bun french toast '' , `` the benedict '' , and the `` seasonal fruit and berry '' accord to the menu . the person on the phone have no idea what any of those be and i be inform they only have regular french toast , `` egg benny '' , and either a fruit plate or a berry plate . ok then , whatever . . . just bring me my freakin ' food already ! ! anyway , sorry for the rant but the food service ordeal be enough of a pain that it knock the whole hotel experience down several notch for me . if you should stay here , ask for a room that doesn ' t face the freeway and find a restaurant close by .",0,508
"shade of green be a really nice hotel set aside for military personnel and their family . it do not have much of a disney theme , but it be very pretty and sedate . the room be large , and the winding ground be pretty to walk through a light jazz play on ambient speaker if you can stand that . i think this place be design to be peaceful more than embrace any particular disney theme , but there be a status of mickey and cartoon ( silently ) play in the lobby for the kid . it be locate across the street from the polynesian , make it an easy walk to the monorail , but we opt for the bus to the ttc that leave every twenty minute . bus to the park run every hour , and there be a useless video bus schedule post that show the hour of the park but not what time the bus arrive and depart the hotel and the park . how be that a schedule ? it should be note that for some reason they be very strict about ask for personal and hotel id when use any bus to and from the resort . not an inconvenience , really , just . . . odd . it ' s barely a security feature and other resort bus don ' t require it so i never really figure out the paranoia . they have restaurant on site for different theme buffet in the evening , but no real hangout for adult aside from the pool . there be a very nice café downstairs near the bus stop that serve breakfast item a fast a they can , include fresh- squeezed orange juice which impress me . there be a gift shop on site with military canteen price for sundries , but they will only sell bottle of wine to active duty or retired military . we be sponsor by a military family we be vacation with so be slightly annoy by that , since again we could just walk across the street to the polynesian and buy a bottle from their gift shop . what be really annoy though be that the family we be travel with , while veteran , couldn ' t buy anything either since they be neither active nor have retire . yet they be allow to stay at the resort to thank them for their service . military rule , i suppose , but i find it wacky . it should also be note that while the room be spacious and comfortable , the hotel ' s water be very soft make rinse a chore . so this hotel be nice , and with the cut rate they charge it really make it a bargain to help you do disney on a budget . still , if i ' m go to disney i think i ' d prefer something great over something nice .",1,502
"i love this hotel ! before this i stay at two other moderate property , port orleans riverside which i like a lot and coronado spring which i think be nothing special . this be a girl only ( me and my mom ) trip for my birthday . my parent be already dvc member , but they use their point this year on a cruise , so i do my research and we like what we saw with this place . since i do my research i know that this be a very large property . we make a few building request and get build 25 in the martinique section . we also request a water view and get it . it be a great view and we be close to everything . the food , shop and bus stop be a very short walk . we eat in the food court for breakfast almost every morning . they breakfast be very good and fill . the weather be gorgeous . it be sunny and about 80- 85 everyday so we take our food outside to the eat area by the water . for some reason we be alone every morning . no one else want to take advantage of the perfect weather . the food court be nice and all , but the eating area be nothing special when you have the option of sit outside . we weren ' t bother by bird so that wasn ' t the problem , but for some reason we be the only one sit outside each morning . we still can ' t figure it out ! each `` island '' section have it ' s own pool . it ' s a basic no frill pool , but it be quieter and le crowd than the main themed pool . the main pool look very nice with it ' s setting , but we swim at our island ' s pool for the quiet . there be also bathroom and coin laundry by each island pool . this property be not far from epcot and in certain area you can view illumination . our building be tuck back in a bay so we couldn ' t see around the tree , so for two night during our stay , we go to the gift shop , pick up a six- pack and sit at one of the quieter table outside in that area . consider the distance , we have a great view ! the room itself be very nice . the decor be very nice and room do not seem date even though this be the oldest moderate at wdw . the service be top notch . every cast member be friendly and helpful ! we have a car so we do not make use of the bus while we be here . we enjoy every moment we be here and i would highly recommend this property to anyone !",1,502
"- service : amazing ! ! the customer service here be top notch , and they always try to go above and beyond to a+ service . this last time around we be greet with a glass of champagne , and flavor water for the we one at the front lobby desk . . . - food : yum , the morning breakfast buffet might be a little pricey ( $ 20 a person ) , but be delicious and have a self serve juice bar with a nice selection of fresh fruit and veggie . they also have a sushi bar , pub like bar , a starbucks in house ( private own , so a couple different rule for member ) , pool side cafe , and an all night room service order menu . - environment : awesome , they have a nice size pool , 2 large hot tub , brand new childrens water park , 2 social fire pit , video arcade , walk garden , full equip gym , and many more . my wife and i love the special aqua fill jelly tile near the arcade , fun to walk on . don ' t let the outside fool you , because the inside be jaw drop with the open court feel inside . a must see ! ! ! - cleanliness : extremely clean and new- bathroom ( s ) : clean and stocked- price : worth it , we pay $ 90 a night with military discount . the best $ 90 spent ! ! - parking : $ 15 a day ( see special comment ) - location : great , close to everything especially to seaworld ( walk distance ) , aquatica , and discovery cove . - coupon : none for stay , but they have little offer to give for park visit if you ask . we get a free speed pas ( quick queue ) for all the seaworld rid , plus it allow u free ride on the seaworld tower lift and paddle boat . - special comment : if you find yourself want to sleep in sometimes they will allow you to checkout an extra 1- 3 hour late , but varies due to how full they be that day . . . another helpful tip be if you have a seaworld pas you can park your car at seaworld over night ( it will save you a $ 15 park fee at the hotel . ( just ask a seaworld associate about leave your car over night and you will just have to fill out a waiver form at the customer service office inside the park ) . free wi- fi be locate any where near on the 1st floor near the front lobby area ( not conference wi- fi ) , but be only good for 2 hour . try log off and/ or reboot system to bypass that rule . . .",1,501
"it ' s close to the theme park ( with a rental car ) , very inexpensive , and provide decent enough amenity on the property for a traveler look for the most bang for their buck - just don ' t expect too much from this budget price hotel . free parking , internet , hot breakfast , and a quaint little pool all add up to a great value for any traveler who isn ' t too particular about the nicety or detail . prosfree parking , wi- fi , hot breakfast , and a cozy pool/ bbq areaquick check- in and friendly staffproximity to theme park and restaurants/ shoppingconsthe room be a bit dingy ( clean , but old and need a refreshing ) i stay 3 night . i book a cheap hotel room because i assume that i ' d be at the theme park all day and would be too tire to care about the room . there be nicer budget hotel out there , but at the same time , there be nothing wrong with this hotel - i actually think it would be perfect for traveler with low fund ( college student , large family , etc ) who aren ' t expect much or try to do anything fancy . if you ' re the cooking type , you can save some money by cook your meal in the kitchen . the pool be small and cozy - great when nobody be there but kind of awkward when there be too many guest there . it ' s a great spot to cool off after a hot day at the theme park . the breakfast be usually pack with folk try to load up before head out to their respective theme park so don ' t be surprise if you have to wait to use the waffle maker - it ' s not the best free breakfast but it ' s much better than eat at the theme park or fast food . everyone ' s travel need be different - i happen to be particular about the little thing and actually want a very nice experience when i travel . without it be a negative comment , i wish that i would have pay a few more dollar and stay at a nicer hotel . i ' m sure the room be clean , but the dinginess make me put a bed sheet over the couch and i wear flip flop the entire time - definitely in need of a little refreshing . it ' s an average budget hotel but if you suffer from hotel germ paranoia or want a nice hotel experience , then you ' re probably better off pay more money for a better hotel . it ' s nice for what it be and isn ' t a bad place to park your luggage during the day especially if you aren ' t picky .",1,500
"this review be for the spa at the ritz- carlton . overall , hotel be lovely ( didn ' t stay in a room ) with guest area and lobby stately and well- staffed . a bit of a walk to the spa building , but that mean it would be tranquil a need . check- in at reception be quick and cordial , and i be then whisk via elevator to the locker room area . attendant here be very gracious , well- mannered and kind explain all feature for the lady spa area . change into a super comfy robe and slipper and wait in the quiet lounge with a cup of tea a few moment before my massage therapist take me up to the treatment room . enjoy a 50- minute signature massage and it be lovely . very relax ! you ' re give a choice of three essential oil ( rosemary , lavender or orange ) . all smell wonderful ! therapist have a perfect touch / right amount of pressure . my only little complaint be that her hand be so cold ! and the massage oil be a bit chilly too . secondly , there be a cd playing in the room , and it loop 3x with the same song . it be nice , classic music , but by the third time , i be bore of it . please buy a 60- minute cd ! ! ! the spa have a wonderfully spacious , clothing- optional jacuzzi , steam and sauna in the lady section and the area be well stock with fluffy towel , cool washcloth , water and the like . sunlight pours into the area and it ' s a nice , quiet place to relax . don a bathing suit and swim a few lap at the adult only spa pool - so quiet here ! pool temp on the chilly side but that be actually quite nice after all the heat jacuzzi dip and trip to the steam and sauna . have to say : i be a bit dismayed when i notice the pool itself be in need of a good cleaning . lot of bug in it , leave from nearby tree and shrub . also , there be a wrought iron gate type thing next to the hot tub and it be rust , worn and bit of rusty paint peel off and fall on the ground . some general housekeeping and this part of the hotel would be pristine . enjoy a glass of wine and fruit and cheese plate by the pool in the sun before retire to the spa for a quick shower and change , then back out to the `` real world '' . definitely recommend for a full or half- day experience . i come here to relax after run a marathon the day prior and it be everything i want : soothing and restorative .",1,500

"certainly nothing special , but i suppose just what you would expect from a day inn . i stay recently for 3 night while attend a convention in orlando and find the location to be pretty convenient to the occc , which be a 5- 10 minute walk away . on site there be a medium- sized pool and park which be rumor to be free . very conveniently locate to restaurant ( denny ' s , mcd ' s , red lobster , etc. ) and a walgreens store . step away from the i- trolley green line . the room that i stay in be clean but worn and dank feeling . there be an extremely strong odor of a cleaning substance when you come in the room which i would frighteningly become accustomed to after a few minute . i didn ' t have any issue with bug and i find my room neat and clean when i arrive , though i skip maid service during my stay a the lady i pass with their cart seem particularly miserable , which i didn ' t take a a good sign . my room have a mini- fridge and microwave . the motel have an ihop attach that be open 24- 7 , so there be no continental breakfast include . wifi connectivity be reliable and pretty fast during the evening and early morning when i be use it . my only serious complaint be in regard to arrangement for transportation back to the airport when i be leave . i call to the front desk to ask for the number for a few taxi cab company so i could call and make arrangement . the manager at the front desk would not give me the number ( literally refuse me 3 time when i ask ) but say they would arrange for a driving service to pick me up at 4 : 15am a need . the driving service be not only late but be more expensive than the taxi for 2 people . the driver arrive 20 minute later than the pick up time so he could also accommodate two other passenger who end up have a credit card issue and delay u another 25 minute . so , 45 minute late hit the road and when we finally arrive to the airport the driver nearly take u to the gate of the group who have require the later pick up time . i speak up in time to get it correct to get drop off at my gate , but the driver never even acknowledge that he have do anything wrong that morning . lesson learn : when the service desk at the day inn try to give you their driver who they be in cahoot with , insist on get cab number yourself .",0,480

( * unfortunately we can ' t remember the name of the concierge but if anyone from management read this , the woman work on the evening of saturday , october 19th deserves recognition for her great service ! ) a final word in regard to build placement also seem to be in order . we be place in building d. this be not immediately adjacent to either of the pool or the bar . however , this be absolutely no issue at all . within minute we could be anywhere on the property . in fact , if one be to walk from one end of the resort to the other it would still be quicker and shorter than just walk to the nearest pool at many of the better know mega resort associate with the park in the area . our entire experience be wonderful and the resort provide u with a tremendous value ! on our next trip there be no question a to where we will be stay !",1,479
"just return from a four night stay at the royal pacific . all in all , be very disappointed consider how much we be pay . here be the pro and con . a you ' ll see , the con outnumber the pro . pro : - hotel ground and accommodation be very nice and they definitely embrace the hotel ' s south seas/ hawaiian theme . - hotel provide easy access to both universal parks- staff be very gracious , for the most partcons : - too many smoker . although the property be 100 % smokefree indoors , there be no outdoor smoking restriction , so every time we step outside , instead of smell fresh florida air , the first thing we get hit with be cigarette smoke . - no smoking restriction poolside . again , hard to relax and unwind when you ' re choke and gag on someone else ' s bad habit . - pool be filthy . loose long hair strand , plastic cup and tiny break off piece of foam from pool noodle be everywhere in the water . - too loud . there be no soundproof between guest room and the hallway specifically . ironically most of the hallway noise come from shout parent , not kid a you might expect . - express pass be not worth it . even with the express pass we wait , on average , for about 15 minute per ride and some our longest `` express '' wait be closer to 45 minute . also , very important to note that none of the newest harry potter ride allow for express access and at time the wait time for the escape from gringott ' s ride exceed , four hour . . . yes , four hour . we ' take advantage ' of the early morning access for on- site guest and arrive at the park at 8 : 00 and even then end up wait two hour . another family also on the line tell u that they have hear that the line for gringotts actually open at 7 : 00 a. m. , even though universal studio ' s official early opening time be 8 : 00 a. m. for on- site hotel guest . consider that the line be already completely mob when we get there at 8 : 00 , i have to presume that this be true . all in all , i think universal simply have more guest than it can reasonably accommodate with the express pass . a 15- minute wait on average be hardly ' no line , no wait ' a they claim . stay onsite simply isn ' t worth it . next time , will do walt disney world and sea world for sure and skip universal altogether .",0,479
"this be some what of an odd hotel to me , for some reason the decor and layout felt more like vega . during my trip , i end up stay in the garden wing , which be detach from the main building . i will have to say that they number of the room be a bit odd , how the 5000s and 6000s where on the same floor . some of the higher point of the hotel include : - magic express- this be by far the cheapest and easiest option when travel between the hotel and airport . one downside to this be that you may end up on a bus with some scream kid . - check- in counter- disney know how to organize a massive crowd and get people through a line . the `` cast member '' , disney ' s term not mine , be very friendly and helpful . - location , location , location- the hotel be locate on the monorail which alllowed for easy transportation between some of the park . the hotel be also locate right across the street from the magic kingdom which allow for a quick walk into the park . it be also normally the first stop on the bus to other park , so you be more likely to get a seat and get off earlier when return . - room- the room appear to be spacious and everything have a `` new '' feeling . there be no real apparent wear and tear consider how many people/ family most likely rent the room . - gift shops- because there be never enough shop one can do . if you aren ' t able to go to the park , there be 2 store locate off of the 4th floor to purchase gift . - restaurants/ snacks- there be a variety of restaurant locate in this hotel . there be also a quick serve offering that have sodas , snack , etc . one of the best find be adult yahoo , kahlua mudslide in a bottle . some of the con : - walking- they layout be just odd . depend on where your room be locate , you can expect to have a nice walk . if you have a family member with difficulty , make sure that you get a room close to an elevator . - the decor- yes it be definitely modern , but sort of vega tacky . it kind of remind me of the mgm in a way . - the beds- if you like firm bed , than this hotel be for you . i can honestly say , that in 5 year of my travel , this be by far one of the most painful sleeping experience i have have .",1,475

( mind you , it be 6 : 30 on a sunday- what if i didn ' t have the necessary fund ? ) i have to remind the attendant how utterly insane it be to hold u responsible for something the hotel ' s employee have do on his own accord . after 15 minute of debate , i be finally give a key to my room and they do not charge me for their mistake . i be very offend at the way i be treat . our stay have be pay in full and we be a mere 8 hour away from head to the airport . we be late to dinner . also , there be a giant wolf spider on the wall behind the bed about 4 inch from crawl down by my head when i wake up . never again .",0,467

"i stay here from january 10- 14 , 2013 and would highly caution against this hotel . upon arrival , i find the woman at the check- in to be abrupt , short , and unwilling to provide information about the hotel amenity ; even the pool operating hour . furthermore , i be never inform a major pending renovation project on my floor , even though i request a quieter room . upon enter the room , i find it to be in unacceptable condition . the bed be not properly make , there be no toilet paper in the room , no information concern hotel amenity , no soap or shampoo , and there be a small amount of feces in the toilet . i immediately call to explain and be tell that all other room be `` allocated '' at this time and because i book via priceline , change of my room can not be honor . needle to say , i consider check out on the spot , regardless whether i would receive a refund for my stay . i stay , but the entire stay be uncomfortable . the next evening , i recognize that i have no contact lens solution . a call to the front desk ask if they have any available or sell any lead to an abrupt `` no. `` after a drive to a local grocery store to get some and while walk through the lobby the next day , i be shock to find a large supply of contact lens solution for sale in the gift shop immediately adjacent to the check- in area . the next day , my room be not clean nor service . a call to reception for towel lead to one hand towel be leave at the foot of my door 2 hour later . the next day , unannounced construction begin which be extremely loud . upon explore the noise while attempt to sleep , i find that they be replace the wallpaper and begin to replace the carpet on my floor . upon attempt to leave my room at one point that afternoon , i be tell to `` wait 5 minute '' so they could finish work . throughout the day , construction worker brush against my door , etc . above all of this , loud music begin in the pool area by 8am daily . i expect much , much more from my stay after read review of the hotel and it do not nearly meet my expectation . three call to the reception area to question these discrepancy be unsuccessful , and although i ask to speak to a manager at one point , i never receive the opportunity to do so .",0,466
"i stay here for my daughter ' s cheerlead competition . qualifier - didn ' t eat , swim , golf or use the internet . my impression ; the place be enormous . the hotel be separate from the convention area by a long area flank by restaurant ( include a starbuck ) and the obligatory gift shop . the hotel be very well keep up and the staff be exceedingly friendly . i ' m sure have a thousand cheerleader isn ' t easy on them but the staff be all well train and very courteous - from the guard at the gate come and go to the parking lot attendant . the room be very well appoint and the amenity be an upgrade from those normally distribute . the room be well insulate . we be on the 2nd floor which be the same floor a the lobby . normally i like to be at the top but this actually work out well since i didn ' t have to wait for the elevator . our room ( two bed ) be sufficiently large and in great shape . toilet\ shower be separate room from the sink\ mirror which be in the main room but around the corner . we didn ' t swim but it look like the pool area be large and nice . parking be $ 16 per day and it can be a 5- 15 minute walk to the lobby from the parking lot depend on how crowded it be . you can make most of the walk indoors if the convention area door be open . they do have valet parking . internet be $ 9 . 99. the charge for park and internet be the only reason i didn ' t give it 5 star . my only other suggestion be better policing of the way people park in the parking lot . idiot be park every which way and where there be not spot . not the hotel ' s fault but make for issue try to navigate the lot . there be a publix and a couple restaurant right across the street ( it ' s a hike so you would probably have to drive - the drive from the road to the hotel be 1/ 3 mile . the drive to disney be about 20- 25 minute ( depend on traffic of course ) . the drive to universal be about 10- 15 minute . all in all i would recommend this property highly if you ' re look for upscale accommodation in orlando . i don ' t know what it ' s like in the summer but it ' s so large i can ' t imagine it get too claustrophobic .",1,466
"book this hotel , i be really unsure of what to expect . everyone , not just on yelp- be complain about everything from the elevator , the room and even the air conditioning . but our experience be totally different ! we arrive at the airport quite early ( 7a . m. to be exact ) and call the hotel to see if we could do an early check- in . to my surprise they agree without hesitation and a soon a we get to the hotel we be in our room within minute . the front desk people ( the morning woman to the afternoon/ night men ) be extremely great to u . actually the staff in general be great . the first morning we decide to try their breakfast buffet , and all though there be a lot of choice , at $ 14 or so- be a vegetarian i be quite limited but for everyone else i think there be fairly enough choice . i definitely would recommend go to the diner locate all around the hotel ( i. e denny ' s , ihop or maybe even dunkin donut ) a they be cheaper . our room be spacious and clean . we be lucky to get one of the newer renovate room which in my opinion look beautiful . we book through expedia which give u two bed instead of one king bed . the bed be extremely comfortable and soooo soft . some people hat that the sink be locate outside the bathroom but it work out fine for my bf and i. while he shower i would be brush my teeth or do my makeup . i think it be extremely useful . we be not in our room enough to even notice the `` loud '' air conditioning and it be cold during our stay anyways . the elevator be slow at time but when that happen we always use the stair . the shuttle that they offer be useful to u . the shuttle to epcot , animal kingdom and hollywood studio be limited but we usually take the more flexible shuttle to magic kingdom and from there use the disneyworld bus to our designate park . we would do the same thing for our return shuttle if another park have a more desired time . overall i would highly recommend this hotel . the only thing i didn ' t like be the $ 95 in resort fee that we accumulate during our stay . $ 19 a day be wayyy to much especially when we never really use the amenity . it be my bf and i first time and when we come back we definitely would come back to the sheraton .",1,466
"we have stay at the hilton grand vacation suit on international drive before and decide to try this property since the price be right . we get a studio suite and they locate at u in the building next to the lobby on the 5th floor . the room be nice and clean and we have a view of the pool . the room include a microwave , dish , a bar sink , and a refrigerator . besides the king bed , it also have a table with two chair and a small loveseat . we go down to the bar/ restaurant a couple of time . the food we have be very good and reasonably price for a hotel . my hubby have the bleu burger and i have the salmon burger . they both come with fry . we like the food so that we eat there a couple of time . it also rain one day and we rent a couple of movie for $ 3/ each for a one day rental ( have to be return the next day before noon ) . the resort provide child activity and social activity at the pool , weather permit . they have ice cream sundae or ice cream float for sale , free beer sampling , with game and activity for the kid . i think they do a quick check to see if there be any kid in pool area , and if they be , they do the activity . if not , they just do the adult theme one . because this be a timeshare property , they will push for you to go to the presentation but they only pursue that when we check in and the next day . the resort also have a small movie theater and showcase one or two movie a day . we do not do this but there be a number of family that would take advantage of the free movie . at the bigger pool area , there be two pool with three hot tub in that area . the one with the waterfall be a cooler swim pool . the one with the fountain be warmer . the hot tub between the two swimming pool be the warmer of the three . we be there in the begin part of september which mean it be hot and humid which be good pool weather . however , every day it either storm or threaten to storm so the pool be close until the storm pass and they shut the pool area at 11 : 00 pm . overall , i would recommend this hotel if you be go to the park or just hang out at the hotel like we do .",1,466
"my family and i stay here for our recent trip to universal studio ( aug 13th- 17th ) and really enjoy our stay . we have a positive all around experience , but i just want to highlight a few thing that i think be important . ( within the resort ) : room : nice enough and on- par with the pricing . nothing really over the top . clean service be timely and pleasant . the only thing that i absolutely could not get over be the smell of whatever detergent they use to wash the towel and bed linen . it smell awful ! even my 11 year old notice it and say that his pillow smell horrible . the resort be dog friendly , so keep that in mind if you be travel with anyone who have allergy . food : decent quality & amp ; reasonably price . if you be travel with child , encourage them to eat from the child ' s menu ! ! my 11 yr old son be offend we make him order from the child ' s menu , but the price on regular menu be out of control and the portion be huge ! you ' ll probably save more eating in the resort than out at city walk or within universal/ island of adventure , but definitely be mindful of how large the portion be on the adult menu for child ! ! entertainment for child : there be a game room downstairs near the shops/ pool . money pit ! the game be all outdated and expensive . the room be small and hardly keep my son ' s attention for more than 20 minute , after have spent $ 40 ! i suggest the game room at nascar cafe . it be much larger and the game be better . the staff at the pool do a great job of get kid to participate in activites : bingo , water volleyball , relay game . at night they host a showing of a movie ( harry potter , despicable me . . . ) at the pool . kid can swim and hang out , while the parent relax and enjoy some cocktail from bula ' s bar . * * this be just my opinion , but i dont think the hotel be `` secure '' enough to allow child under the age of 15 to roam around themselves . there be easy access to and from universal in to the resort . i be shock by how many child be run around with no adult supervision . the staff be very attentive , but they aren ' t babysitter ( nor should they be require to be ) .",1,466

"stay here because my bf be attend a conference in the hotel . the main draw for most people seem to be that they ' re attach to the mall . i find the location pretty horrible . you ' re surround by a sea of car because of the mall parking lot , and on the perimeter of that chain type restaurant . for me though - the biggest disappointment be the pool area . since i be tag along to a conference i figure i ' d enjoy myself lay out at the pool and sip cocktail . the pool be surround by a cement wall , dozen of lounge chair be place around the pool , but there be no shade , 2 round table , no umbrella and no bar . they have 2 floaty mat , 2 ! for the whole pool . so whoever get the 2 mat - everyone else look on enviously while they float around . the ambiance couldn ' t have be worse . if you want a drink you have to exit the pool area , go to the hotel restaurant across the lobby in your bathing suit - cricket - and order a drink , ( $ 10 for a slushy type drink ) , then bring it back to the pool area , while use your room key to open the pool door , transfer it to a plastic cup and take it back to your chair - be there be no side table to put it on . they really need to up their game there . the room be decent , but again - skimp on amenity , cheap shampoo & amp ; no conditioner , and although we book a king room they run out and give u 2 queen . they ' comped ' u with 2 starbucks card worth $ 5 each , which quickly get burn up at the overpriced starbucks the next morning . no free coffee to be have which be shock consider it be a conference type hotel . i guess they want you to buy starbucks . didn ' t eat in the hotel - breakfast be too expensive for what middle price hotel give you for free a a perk . also - we want to go to a local water park and ask the concierge if there where any ticket deal - she quote u a price double what i have find online . so i ' m not sure if she be incompetent or if they get a kickback . i buy the ticket online and print them in the business center , which be one nice feature of the hotel .",0,458
"i be unimpressed by the miilitary ' s shade of green hotel resort . apparently it ' s build in a former golf club and part of it seem cramped and dark . not much of an entryway or lobby , either . to get to shade of green from orlando , i take the lynx city bus # 111 from the airport to the disney transportation center and wait for the specific shade of green bus to the resort . ineffecient but cheap . if it wasn ' t for the disney orlando resort , there wouldn ' t be any need for shade of green because there isn ' t any other there there . in contrast , one of my favorite military resort be the hale koa in hawaii , with the resort in tokyo and germany just behind . the shade of green mwr ticket counter be by far the most ineffeciently- run place in all of disney ( or perhaps even florida ) . an elderly , slow , poorly organize gentleman be the only employee there to serve a line of about twenty military family try to get various disney ticket . every little transaction take him 15- 20 minute . i bet some patron wait almost an hour ( in the early afternoon ) to buy their disney ticket . get your disney ticket at your local base mwr before you arrive in orlando ! if they don ' t have them in stock , they can order them for you . just don ' t plan on `` stopping by '' shade of green for anything . i didn ' t see any cafe or restaurant or counter that seem decent enough for a casual lunch . maybe it be the time of day ( 2pm ) , but everything seem half empty and dark . resort signage be terrible and get around the public area of the hotel wasn ' t logical . their mini- mart be a tiny joke , so don ' t plan on buy anything there unless it ' s a true emergency and you don ' t mind the brand or type . in comparison , the hale koa in waikiki have a lovely mini- mart . i be hop that shade of green would be a resort i might want to stay at in the future when i visit disney ( because their room be cheaper and a bit larger than many other disney hotel ) , but that ' s not the case . i be glad to leave here and don ' t plan on return . nothing unpatriotic or anything , but shade of green be disappoint .",0,456
"i see the recent negative review for the swan & amp ; dolphin and wonder if i get lucky , or what . because i really enjoy it here . i stay in a room at the dolphin for a few night , partially for fun and partially for business . not sure if my spg status get me a nicer room than normal , but i be in room 1169 and i love it . it ' s on the restaurant level and kind of a hike from elevator but worth the walk . the room be on a corner with a slide glass door that lead to a little patio with a view of the `` lake '' and `` beach '' with the swan boat , and the other wall have a huge window look out to the lake which divide the swan and dolphin . pedestrian traffic be not bad and far enough away from the room to not bother me at all . it be also a quick walk to the wonderful pool area , complete with cabana bar and several pool with a waterfall and waterslide . my parent actually come over from a nearby resort they stay at for cheaper just to hang out at the dolphin ' s pool . i be also impress with the food in the hotel . sure , it ' s resort price , but everything i have at the fresh mediterranean market , garden grove , soda fountain place , cabana bar and bluezoo be decent or even great . i could tell that the room be older and maybe some fixture could stand to be update , but i didn ' t find anything to be crappy or unkempt . i hate when hotel try to tuck in flat sheet and use them a fit sheet because it never hold up , but that ' s a minor complaint . business- wise , the mlb winter meeting take over the resort this week and the dolphin do a great job of handle that from what i could tell . ton of satellite bar in the evening and enough walkway throughout the lobby to cut through the crowd . have go to the meeting in other hotel , this be one of the more tolerable layout for it . also , the wifi do not slow down too much even with the crowd . i never have to pay the daily fee for the faster wifi , which be unexpected . so , yeah , maybe i be just happy it be adult time after be cram into a room with the kid , but i like it fine .",1,454

"i must preface my review by say my fiance and i be all about value and practicality . we don ' t swim at the hotel ( there ' s so much else to do in orlando ! ) and we definitely don ' t spend $ 100 on spa treatment , over- price in- hotel restaurant , or generic gift shop . with so much cheap competition nearby , it ' s amazing to me what they charge for universal resort room . we ' ve stay at orlando hotel price a low a $ 40 and be just a comfortable in our room a the royal pacific . difference between a $ 40 hotel and loews that we find important : - $ 40 hotel you have to buy an $ 80+ fastpass per person to get on the quick line for ride at universal . at loews you use your room key and you ' re in . depend on how much you pay for your room at loews , you might break even here ( we do not ) . still , i ' ll give this one a tie . - $ 40 hotel you park at your room , take a 2 mile drive to universal , pay $ 10 there , and walk ( use people mover ) a few minute from the parking garage . at loews , you pay $ 15 to self- park ( really ? ! ) a good walk from the hotel entrance ( suck if you have bag , but it ' s $ 20+ to valet ) and then walk a half mile or sit on a lame 20 min boat ride to get to universal . winner : $ 40 hotel- $ 40 hotel will generally accomodate you if you arrive earlier than the 4pm check- in . at loews , we have to check in our baggage and find something to do for an hour until 4 : 15 pm ( roam the property , drink some lemon- infused water , watch the little train go around 40 time , sit and stare at the lobby attendant . . . ) . winner : $ 40 hoteli imagine that if you have kid , pack multiple people to a room , enjoy nice decoration and pretty vegetation , or simply have plenty of cash to spend then this hotel would be a perfectly satisfy value for you , which be why i didn ' t give it 1 star , but a this didn ' t apply to u we will not be stay at the loews royal pacific resort again any time soon .",0,451

"let me preface by say that a soon a we check into this dump , i remember why we avoid stay in disney ' s resort at all cost . i be hat it ! ! ! spend $ 100 to stay in a room just a little bigger than my closet . here ' s a visual . if you ' re sit on the toilet and happen to forget to shut the door , there be not enough room for you to shut it without scrap your knee . the furniture be so old and nasty . yes . it be their `` value '' hotel . but come on . they could at least update the furnishing to make up for the small room . we ' ve previously stay at disney ' s wilderness lodge which i believe be disney ' s moderately price for $ 250+ , the room there be just a small also . practically same room , different tacky decor . we ' ve also stay at the contemporary , disney ' s high end resort ( $ 300+ ) . again , small but at least the decor be more tastefully do . my point be , it doesn ' t matter if you stay in disney ' s value or high end resort , the room be gon na be tini- tiny . orlando be saturate with 4- star hotel that $ 100 will get you a couple day in a 4- star , all pimp out hotel ( if book thru one of the travel online site ) . it might not be on disney property but many 4- star hotel be close enough . there be a hilton & amp ; a brand new wyndham on disney property for the same price a the this hotel . to be fair , we ' ve never stay in any of the suite . this be only a review of the `` preferred '' room . we also book this room on a whim without a lot of think through disney . we have disney pass and think it would have be easy to park hop and stay the night somewhere convenient . for this reason , it serve a purpose . i be still a huge disney fan . i would have give this resort a 1 star if i be just rating the room . but the amenity outside the room would make any kid happy i. e. the pool , the playground , the easy access to any wdw park . i just win ' t stay in their value resort ever again ! ! ! !",0,450

"the worst hotel experience i have ever have . i stay a total of four night in a two king suite ( i don ' t know why they call this choice a suite , it be just a room ) . every single day/ night there be a problem with housekeeping . i make reservation ahead of time directly through the resort - they know it would be a party of 4. upon arrival , one bed have no linen on it , and we be provide with two towel . i have to call the desk and ask for the bed to be prepare and towel to be bring up - this take an hour for them to do - i shouldn ' t have even have to ask for this , never mind wait an hour ! the hotel offer `` refresh service '' ( daily towel replacement , trash emptying , bed make ) . . . what a joke . on my second day , housekeep didn ' t empty the garbage ( i have to take it out myself ) , they once again leave two towel for four people , and they leave u with no tissue or toilet paper - once again , i have to call the desk and ask for items/ service that should have be provide . on day three , a towel issue again - once again cause me to call the desk . on day four , housekeep never show up at all ! i call the desk at 4pm and be tell `` housekeeping be still work on rooms. `` at that point , i ask for clean towel , and they never arrive . i ask again at 7pm - nothing . they never show up to bring towel , empty trash , make bed . when i ask for two coffee pack , i be tell they would cost me a dollar each . seriously ? ? you can ' t give two coffee k- cup to a room for no extra charge ? i be completely disgust with the service ( or lack of service ! ) i receive at this so- call resort . i be by no mean a picky person , but this be ridiculous . i would never stay there again , and would never recommend it to anyone . the only bright spot be the bartender at the pool area ( i wish i have get his name ) . he be friendly and welcome , despite the obvious fact that he be work his tail off - job well do by him .",0,446

"i get a really good deal on this hotel through expedia unpublished rate , but i still would not go back or recommend it for anyone travel to orlando for pleasure - might be good a a convention hotel . + location be good and close to universal , also close to a lot of restaurant and touristy shop on international dr. + room be renovate and nice+ pool and spa area be nice- the entrance be very weird and confusing , if you enter towards the restaurant it be basically impossible to find the lobby . then even when you get orient , it be a pain to drive around to your room because the building be spread out and the road doesn ' t go in a full loop- the check- in do take a while- wall be very thin . we be in an adjoining room and could hear everything from the people next door , a well a everyone walking by . have to play white noise on my phone and turn on the fan to drown out the noise- housekeeping be inconsistent and somewhat sloppy , for example , they give u more toiletry but just set them next to the tv ? lol- shuttle service to universal studio only go out 3x in the morning and come back 2x in the afternoon . also 2/ 3 time we take it , it be late . be very annoyed because we wake up early to leave on the shuttle at 8 , and it didn ' t show up until near 8 : 30. several people be wait around , and i call the lobby and they be apologetic , but at that point i felt they should offer to just call u a cab . also , they make it seem like wyndham have it own shuttle , but it ' s actually just share with a bunch of hotel . it ' s nice because the wyndham be the last stop so it ' s really not that annoy , but i imagine wyndham would have it own van shuttle people back and forth throughout the day , which be def not the case . on the other hand , the shuttle to the convention center come several time while we be wait for the universal shuttle- when i try to take a shower , the water take 10- 15 min to get hot ! overall , i think the bad outweigh the good , and with all the really nice place in orlando , i would upgrade to something a little bit better .",0,442

"i ' ve make two trip to disney now . first time we stay in all star sport , second time all star music . i figure there wouldn ' t be much difference since they be side by side and price the same . but there be a big difference for u . our entire experience be regrettable . it didn ' t ruin our disney trip ( the park be great ) but take it from an a+ to a c. first we book 4 month in advance and request a room near the parking lot b/ c my wife have foot problem . we get there and we have a room on the top floor in the building at the rear if the complex and at the end of the run . iow we get the furthest possible room from the parking lot in the resort . since we get there before check in time we go to magic kingdom until we get hit and decide to go check into our room to settle in cool off and have some lunch . well we we finally get there the door wouldn ' t open . we try to call the front office but you can ' t get through . long story short it be nearly an hour before they get u into a room , and they end up move u . then the cheer lead dance competition be go on do the place be fill with teenars . but that ' s no problem b/ c after all it be disney world right ? however for each of the first three night they be outside the room shout yelling and play loud music go through routine until about 3 be . i just suffer the first couple of night the third night i call the front desk at nearly 4 be and ask `` do y ' all not have a curfew or noise policy ? `` . they say they do and the problem would be take care of . it be . . . . for about 20 minute . the next morning at 8am a marching band march past the room . which i don ' t mind be wake up at 8 be by tuba and drum , except when i can ' t sleep until 4am after a full day in the heat . overall it seem like a poorly manage resort . i could not believe how much different my experience be from all star sport . do what you want , i doubt i ever stay there again .",0,441
"very disappointing . when book the hotel i have read great review and be that it locate in a good area close to all the park . at first we pull up after 6+ hour of drive and think it look like a nice hotel . check in be simple and quick and be tell we be go into a room with a king size bed . we get up to the room and the room key didn ' t work . after multiple attempt we go back down only to learn they program the key to a different room . we get into our room to see 2 full bed and not a king bed , the bathroom ceiling clearly have a giant leak and water stain with mold in the ceiling and the tub hardware have residue build up on it . we ask to have the room switch and be give a new room no problem . now it ' s 12 at night . in the second room , the bathtub be chip on almost half the tub and they just cover it up with some tan cheap look paint . we actually go out and bring a bath mat and cleaning supply the hotel be so dirty . the light above the sink on the ceiling be dusty . the heater didn ' t work . it be very noisy and not blow out any warm air . we leave it on while we be out think that it just need to warm up only for it to blow out ice cold air while we be go and it still never give out any warm air only for them to tell u it wasn ' t go to work and they would have someone come to fix it tomarrow and would send someone up right away with extra blanket . at 1230 at night they knock on the door hand me one flat sheet and one fit and say that they would bring up blanket a soon a they be finish dry . we go down to complain and they offer u a new room and we didn ' t want to switch room for the 3rd time , we want to leave . the staff at the front desk be great and try everything they could to make u satisfied . the place be disgust and my boyfriend be severe allergy and we weren ' t go to leave at 1 be so we have no other choice but to stay the night . i wouldn ' t recommend this hotel to anyone .",0,440
"this hotel have pretty high star so i decide to go with it for my hotel stay . it be myself , and a 9 year old . first thing to note be that there be no shuttle service from the airport to the hotel . i have to pay an extra $ 80 just to get to this hotel . the hotel be note a a `` neighbor of disney , `` but if you actually intend to go to disney , universal , or anything of any excitement be prepare to pay uber $ 20- $ 40 ( depend on peak time ) just for a one way trip . the hotel offer shuttle to some of the park , but there be only two shuttle service and they aren ' t even schedule to take you until after the park have be open for over an hour , and they pick you up 2 hour before the park even close . there aren ' t any attraction near the hotel , so be prepare to have to find transportation to anything fun . the staff be extremely rude pretty consistently . the young lady who check me in be extremely friendly , but i find rather quickly she be a rarity in that place . between the hotel and the restaurant it be pretty clear that the staff be all sleep together . i know because they be all preoccupy with their own drama and not with do their work . one occasion i saw two employee embrace in an extended hug and cuddling , and in the restaraunt i hear one employee try to pick up another employee . not a very nice family friendly staff . when i be at the pool i ask an employee a question about the location of something at the resort and be tell , `` i don ' t speak english. `` my last night i order a wake up call that i didn ' t receive . luckily i wake up on my own . the restaraunt food be decent quality but overprice . room be big but some light and outlet didn ' t work and the bedroom be miss a tv remote . the hotel itself be very pretty and very cool . but for what you be pay to stay there you mine a well just stay on disney or universal resort . after all the uber fair , it will just average out . and then you win ' t have to deal with the rude staff at melia .",0,436
"a others mention , this be not an outback steakhouse a you would find in other part of the country with aussieboys sing about their bloomin ' onion . i also agree with the assessment this be one tired restaurant . we sit by the edge of the koi pond and the only thing we could figure be people quietly fling bit of bread at those tubbo fish . their entire crop of koi lurk right next to u , gaze and gulp a they eye our food . boy , we think on vacation we ' d get away from the dog begging at the table . every once in a while a large one would stick his head out of the water and gaze reproachfully at u . i have the $ 32 chef ' s dinner special ; my partner have the $ 37 version which include a glass of wine . the salad be okay ( spring mix with spinach and giant chunk of tomato ) , but the main course wasn ' t. i have the salmon and it be heavily salt , which i think be to cover the fishy smell - it be just on the edge of ick . my other half have the steak which be rather fatty . we both have bake potato - they serve you the fixing , but not generously - i have to ask for a second small spoonful of sour cream . i ' m no drinker but that wine be two- buck- chuck quality ( and the waiter , after pock the cork out of the half- full bottle and pour the glass at the table , promptly drop the bottle . it flip and hit the floor , drain a substantial amount into the carpet . he nonchalantly pick up the bottle , stick the cork back in the top and saunter off . still sure you wan na drink that , sweetie ? ) third course , `` key lime soufflé '' . . . soufflé ? sou- floppe . a soufflé be `` a lightly bake cake make with egg yolk and beat egg white '' which be a combination of custard and egg white . . . or it ' s suppose to be . you could sink a battleship with those thing - it be more like key lime cheesecake , but weirdly sticky . the discount for guest be now 15 % , not the 20 % other people mention . really - you ' d do better walking over to downtown disney .",0,436
"this review be solely for the ground and for our tea at the crescent solarium . i do not stay on the premise . the tea itself be be offer on a limited basis - a i understand it- a something of a test run . i can not say enough how desperately i hope it will become a fixture of the resort , because our experience be positively brilliant . the menu have many of the same sort of thing a one expect for tea- tiny sandwich , scone and clot cream . . . of those i must specifically mention the luscious salmon rillettes a an incredible standout amidst a glut of delectable tidbit . the charcuterie platter , which we order a la carte in addition to our tea come present on elegant slab of polished wood and add a slightly heavier counterpoint to the other food , inject a touch of solidity into what be often a rather fluttery , feminine affair . i ' m not say that men shouldn ' t come to high tea , i regret that more of them don ' t , but i do suspect offering meaty thing might aid in get a few more of them through the door . even the description of the tea - i ' ve save the menu for posterity- be splendid , and the quality bear up , leaf pour into little pot with an incredibly generous hand to result in a particularly pleasant brew . i , personally , drink the better part of four pot worth , one of darjheeling and then a pot of oolong , refill twice after to resteep . the sole issue with any aspect of the afternoon , in fact , be that with no way to - remove- the tea leave from the little pot , anything leave in after the second cup be pour oversteeps rather severely . place the leaf in tea caddy or strainer , and all would have be perfection . i wish to extend particular thanks to the dear gentleman responsible for it launch , who so willingly share his exemplary knowledge of tea with all comer , and for the amazing manager who go to some length to see to it we could buy the much- desire tin of oleander- scent oolong . i beg your forgiveness for have forget name , though i will likely never forget your earnest joy in the tea or your bright smile , and i sincerely hope to see you again when next i be in florida .",1,436

"i be actually quite surprised at the rating on here . perhaps travel without child make for a better experience . . . we use a coupon from groupon that get u this room at what i would call a rock bottom rate . i have read the review and decide that i likely wouldn ' t be happy , but cheap be cheap and a free shuttle be free so i could just lump it and get what i get . i be thrill with the room , the ground , the staff , and yes even the small timeshare promo i get . upon check in i be tell all the usual hotel type stuff , show a schedule of activity and send to a second desk for my welcome packet . there be a perhaps 2- 3 minute talk about how if i schedule another trip with them now for $ 99 and sit through a presentation i would get my $ 99 refund and essentially have a free stay . i say no - there be no pressure - and i be off to my room . the only issue i have be that there be no maid service during my stay . it would have be nice to be notify of that at check- in . the trash start to overflow , but there be a convenient dumpster and extra bag available . i be even able to go home with all clean clothes a there be a washer/ dryer in the unit with a free pack of detergent . we interact with several employee and they be all courteous and helpful . i be actually sad we didn ' t stay longer a we didn ' t get to enjoy all of the free activity that be available . take the shuttle to disney one day and it be on time and save me $ 20 parking . the trip be limited and you ' re kind of stuck until the afternoon pick- up and the drop- off/ pick- up location be odd ( no drop at mk , but a pick- up there at 11pm ? ) but a i say before a free shuttle be free . we receive some valuable coupon at check in ( do not miss wild florida - free admission for up to 10 when you check in to your room ) and be thankful for those . i be actually already look into go back to mystic dune . highly highly recommend .",1,426

"i have a flight out from mco the next day , so my dad book this nearby hotel out of convenience . the hotel itself definitely wasn ' t the worst i ' ve be to . however , there be just thing i can ' t ignore : 1. my sister be a hospitality major , so there be some thing you can not do at the front desk . you can not ask the hotel patron to announce their own room number aloud to the front desk . there be other people present , whether or not they be stay at the hotel . this be a hotel guideline that be disgustingly trespass . 2. if you have a certain number of room , you must have a certain number of park space to maintain the number of hotel patron stay at the hotel . there be no parking available , and we be pay for a hotel room . we end up park within 15- 20 foot of a fire hydrant , a we have no other option . all the park spot and curb space be take , and we want to sleep that night in the room we pay for . this be outrageous . 3. the faucet be break . we be expect to wait inside while maintenance fix it . we weren ' t sure if we should stay or trust him not to mess with our personal item . it be just an awkward situation . 4. breakfast be complimentary . i enjoy the openness of the breakfast area , but with much openness come nowhere to sit ? what ? seating be very limited - and with full parking capacity come full hotel capacity - in turn , come full breakfast seating capacity . i stand around wait for somewhere to sit while also wait for someone to refill the pot of coffee . i be not a happy person without my morning cup of joe . 5. i do enjoy the plush and fluffy king size bed - much need after a couple night on a sofa bed and hour spend in a car . pillow be small though - i don ' t have a big head , but these pillow make my head seem big . rant complete . convenience in distance to the airport and many chain restaurant make it hard to complain - this hotel be simply cater to the fly crowd like u , not the leisurely vacationer .",0,424
"overall this be a nice hotel . my hubby have a conference so we bring the kid and make a vaca out of it . we stay for 7 night . what we like : - the pool area be great . lot of option for seat ( sun or shade ) depend on where you sit . two zero entry area which be wonderful for very small kid and an awesome lazy river and water slide . the food at the pool restaurant be decent with normal price for a resort . the service around the pool be hit or miss depend on the day . there ' s a smaller adult pool separate from the main pool area which look relaxing . - the room be nothing too special but adequate and relatively clean . - the elevator be fast . - self parking be easy and attach to the hotel- nice for u a the kid and i run around orlando while my dh be in meeting . - the spa be relax and the staff very accommodate . the service i have do be just ok but the overall experience be good . what wasn ' t awesome : - service at the bistro be hit or miss . the first day we be charge for the kid ' breakfast . every other day we be tell they eat free . the buffet be underwhelming- we weren ' t tell until our last day at the hotel that the buffet include egg benedict , pancake and french toast- you just have to order them through your waiter a they ' re not out at the buffet . at $ 27/ person know those be option would have be nice . neither of these thing area a huge deal but annoy nonetheless . - despite like the food at david ' s club ( check the menu first- it ' s not for everyone ) and have a friendly waitress , the service be so painfully slow it be not a great experience . - the starbucks/ marketplace be a joke . it have a few ok option for grab- and- go food but the service be terrible all three time we stop in . - not close to anything other than the convention center . wasn ' t an issue for u a we have a car but if you don ' t there ' s not much to do within a mile or so of the hotel .",1,423
"on our last night in florida , we stay at the embassy suit in downtown orlando a we be go to the cavs- magic game and want a hotel we could walk to the game from . location of the hotel be great - easy walk to amway ( maybe twenty minute or so ) and there be ton of restaurant and bar around the hotel to pick from . check- in and check- out be quick and easy and the staff be very friendly that we interact with ( valet , front desk , bartender ) . like all other embassy suite , there be a complimentary breakfast from 6 : 30- 9 : 30 be and complimentary drink and snack ( fruit and nacho ) from 5 : 30- 7 : 30 pm at the bar on the first floor . free drink be great with me and my husband , so we be definitely down at the bar at 5 : 30 for a few drink before head to the game . the room itself be a suite , so that be cool , but my major complaint with our particular room be that it be smoke ( we didn ' t even get an option for a non- smoking room ) and we get two twin ( at least they look like twin ) bed ! we try to get switch to a non- smoking room but be tell we couldn ' t. i guess that be what we get for book on priceline and only pay $ 45 for the night . the other negative be no free wireless internet . so i can get free wireless at a best western , but not an embassy suite ? something doesn ' t seem right with that . parking be valet for $ 18 , but most downtown hotel in any american city be pretty much go to be valet only so i didn ' t mind so much . the only thing i think be ridiculous be that they park your car in the lot across the street . at least take my car somewhere where i can ' t see it so i feel like the $ 18 pricetag be worth it . this be really a 3 . 5 star hotel , but be round down because of our room and the lack of wireless internet . i would recommend stay here though if you just want a room in a convenient location .",1,421

"just come back from this beautiful resort . i be here for 3 day and 2 night and because we come for a convention , get it for a really good deal . it be a steal , really . anyway , the whole place be amazingly beautiful and large . a couple of thing : 1 ) no free shuttle , min $ 20 each way for their mear shuttle service or if you ' re use cab service it ' s about $ 60 per cab ride one way ( obviously , split the cost with others but the more the people , the bigger the cab , the more the fare so after the split , it ' s still about $ 15- 20 per person one way ) . 2 ) no free toiletry - everything have to be purchase from their gift shop or convenience shop or whatever . 3 ) rude front desk customer service ( when call in over the phone instead of show up in person ) . . . what ' s the deal with that ? do they realize they give u name when they answer ? ? 4 ) confuse layout . i mean , i figure out how to read the room number because the lady check me in be extremely nice and she clue me in a to how to find my room . but i be there to attend a conference and the place be huuuuge which be awesome and it breathtakingly beautiful but i be in the north tower with the conference room be on the other side of the hotel ( cypress ) . . . and no cut- through ? ? i walk in a big- u. . . . pro : 1 ) large pool area ( indoor and outdoor ) 2 ) hot tub , jacuzzi ' s & amp ; spa3 ) room be roomy and clean , bed be nice and soft , didn ' t watch tv so don ' t know about the quality and i have a clear view of the epcot center . 4 ) food court on level 1 be quick , near the pools/ hot tub and reasonable price for good portion ( for a resort ! ) overall , it be a great experience and i would definitely come back . and i would definitely spend more time at the pool/ hot tub .",1,412
"my 9- year old son and i just spend 7 night at the wdw beach club resort . first the pro ' s , and then the con : pro : - proximity to epcot be unmatched by any other resort . you be allow to enter at 8 : 50am ( even earlier during magic hour ) , which mean you be on the `` uncrowded '' side of future world by 9 : 00am . we walk on test track and soarin ' - twice ! - the beautiful location on crescent lake be stun . you be walk distance to the boardwalk and all the great restaurant ( include epcot restaurant ) . the walk part be huge in wdw ! we even rent a sea racer boat ! - you be walk distance to disney hollywood studio - the gentle walk along crescent lake be magnificent . - the resort have the best wdw pool , and the staff include the kid in everything ! the pool be nirvana after be in the park all day . music and organize volleyball every afternoon at the pool + cocktail service for the adult . at night , there be well organize campfire , roast marshmallow , and outdoor film for the kid . - very good restaurant ( yachtsman steak house ) & amp ; free morning coffee . - the resort be beautiful and attractive . many plant and flower . the staff be friendly and helpful . con : - the room be claustrophobically small , and show wear . the bathroom be tiny . there be noticeable dirt on the wall and furniture . basically , you be pay ritz carlton price for motel 6 quality . cleanliness be a big deal for me , and these room be not clean . - the room be noisy . you can hear everything go on in the hall . after long day in the park and restaurant , you need respite in a clean and quiet room . unfortunately , the beach club can not provide this . summarygreat location and a pool that be simply amaze . next time , i would look into stay at the yacht club side of the resort , or the villa - - i think the room be better sound- proofed and better kept . otherwise , i would stay at the ritz or comparable hotel outside wdw .",1,411
"a a frequent traveler , i spend a lot of time in hyatts . i would consider this one of the more important property in the portfolio since it be the only full service resort cater to the disney crowd in orlando . i be very sympathetic when thing don ' t work exactly a plan - that be a part of life . i do get frustrate however , when these hiccup don ' t get address . self park require a special swipe card - mine do not work . annoying , but not the end of the world . be a resort hotel , you must pay a resort fee which cover a variety of amenity , one of which be a shuttle to and from the theme park . the night i attempt to use it , it be over an hour late and three phone call to the hotel provide no information . i don ' t mind it be late - but how be it that they have no way of figure out why or where it be ? i can ' t be the only one with a cell phone , lol ! i end up take a cab back , which do bother me . the final issue be my room key . neither key i have work , so i go down to the front desk and get them `` re- keyed '' . come back up and again , they didn ' t work . another trip to the front desk which result in have to wait for security to let me in . they provide me a third key which i use and guess what - it still didn ' t work . no one think anything of it which be really annoy at midnight . it would have be even worse if i be say more than one night . when i check out , the front desk staff could have care le . the property ground be really quite nice and the regency club be one of the better one . it be a shame that the staff didn ' t do the property justice . in fairness to hyatt , when i relay my poor experience , they do offer me some point and their apology which i appreciate . i will give them another shot in the future and hope their staff make some improvement .",0,411

"here be the good , the bad and the ugly on this place . first the good . it be a very nice hotel with a friendly staff and great location . we be not more than 10 minute away from all of our planned activity . the bad be that the parking lot be pretty far from the hotel . no big deal unless there be a convention go on and it become full of non- resident parker . i guess there be always valet for $ 20 v the $ 16 they charge for the regular lot . if the place be have a convention the hallway and elevator become packed , at time , with thousand of people . kid roam the hall make a lot of noise a well . the hotel be no longer peaceful . here be the ugly and what have prompt me to write this review . on my second to last day here , my wife and i return to our room , after a long day at hollywood studio , to find deadbolt engage prevent the door from actually close . our room be leave open for god know how long . we also discover $ 100 dollar miss . we call the front desk and they send three people up within the hour . the head of security , the housekeeping manager and the hotel manager . this cause a huge disruption where we be ask a bunch of question and basically tell to call the police . nothing be ever do by them . they didn ' t even call to say they weren ' t go to do anything . hopefully they will believe me now and realize how upset i be by this . it be their responsibility to make sure the room lock after housekeep come in to clean . we just didn ' t feel secure after this incident and it pretty much ruin the rest of our trip . and the fact they offer to do nothing really upset u . a simple dinner voucher or offer to credit even part of park fee on our final bill would of turn this entire experience around . but instead i be leave with a nasty taste in my mouth and distain for this hotel . i will want everyone to know about this and will post it a many place a possible .",0,409
"my family of 5 spent a week here during our disney vacation . we enjoy it so much , i find it hard to imagine stay elsewhere . i feel like we get so much value for what we pay . here be some of the highlight : stay in a deluxe 2 bedroom in tower 2. everything clean , new- look , well- maintain . check in be a breeze . access to disney park be amazing- - le than 5 minute to most park . we have our car with u so we didn ' t use the shuttle . great for a family with small kid that want to return mid- day and have a rest . staff be great . we didn ' t need them for much , but when we interact ( check- in , have some item to pick up/ drop- off in the bell area , etc ) i find the employee to be more than polite . i have read many review of bonnet creek on various disney planning site and some have say that they like everything about it but find it be lack in `` disney magic. `` i have stay on site in a disney resort before and i really think that the level of customer service be comparable . i didn ' t miss any of the little perk like disney people re- arrange our stuffed animal . i be more than willing to trade those perk for my child have their own room ( and their own bed , even ) to collapse into at the end of the day and the ability to have a few meal in the condo during the week . i enjoy restaurant eating a much a the next person but even i like have a few meal `` off '' over the course of a long week . bathtub with jet . omg . best thing ever , i use it almost daily , sometimes during our afternoon rest ( leave me very refresh for go back to the park later in the day ) and sometimes at night . ahhhhh . we only use the pool one day , but enjoy the zero entry pirate pool . my six year old love the water slide . we be very likely to return to bonnet creek on our next disney vacation , whenever that happen to be .",1,408
"i be very disappointed with my stay here . to start , we request adjoin room with one king and two double . we get none of our request - we get room two apart ( why stick another family between u ? ) , and two double in each room . apparently the hotel be book solid and they be renovate some of their room . fine - i can live with this . the room be relatively clean , but very dated . there be a strange smell in one of them - either clean solution or cologne . you couldn ' t open the window so we be stick with this . climate control be atrocious - one room get freeze when the radiator be set to 76f , while the other would not cool off when set to 66f . the air conditioning be loud and annoy . the bed be comfortable , and the bathroom be clean and spacious . the airport shuttle run every hour , which be far too infrequently . the main reason i ' m give it one- star be the inaction of staff when we get noisy neighbour . we be stick on the same floor a a mexican rock band . they get back to their room at 4am and promptly speak loudly in the hall , and repeatedly slam hotel room door . this wake our family ( and doubtless other family ) on the floor up , and we be schedule for a 8am flight . after 30 minute of noise , i phone down to the front desk , and get the response be `` yes , we know . we ' re try to get them to settle down. `` there be nothing in the way of apology or compensation . i book on expedia and pre- paid , so the staff the next morning say there be nothing they could do except feed- back to the manager . i don ' t expect 5- star quality from a 3- star , but i do expect prompt action when people complain . i also would expect a little planning when it come to their guest . a a best western platinum member , i be suppose to have room preference , upgrade potential , etc . what i get be stick in poor room next to noisy neighbor with little action .",0,407
"the free breakfast be very limited . literally just muffin , a few type of cereal and some fruit . the pool be break for 2 out of the 5 day we stay . the parking lot be awful , which isn ' t really their fault . people love to park directly in the middle for whatever reason , make it a pain to back out of a spot or get into one . the hotel didn ' t seem to do anything to stop these guy , and it be for the entire length of my stay . the room be kind of gross . there be hole in the wall all over the room and in the shower . the wallpaper be peel in many spot , and the carpet turn our foot black . the staff be kind of rude , especially on check out . we accidentally lock our key in the room when we be pack our thing , and have to go get a new one . the lady run the desk be really rude about it , and would ask me a question and then ignore anything i have to say . she finally cut me off and tell me `` check out be at 11 thank you ! `` and walk away . out of everything though , the maid be the absolute worst part . the first day , the maid come in and clean , no problem . day 2 , we have the do not disturb sign up . we come back to the hotel and the do not disturb sign be go , and our room clean . maybe not their fault , but still . day 3 , we leave a note on one bed say we ' d like it change and nothing else need to be do . they leave that bed alone and clean the rest of the room . on our last day , we put the do not disturb sign up again . this time , they come in the room , leave u a note say `` since you ask to not be disturb , we didn ' t clean the room today. `` leave me speechless , i ask to not be disturb , why would they go inside my room ? there be many other hotel in this price range , stay somewhere else .",0,407

"i will put it a bluntly a i can . i didn ' t care for this hotel . start off when the front desk inform me they only have king size bed leave . not something that i would panic over but i request 2 bed in the room . the desk say they would send a fold away to the room . nothing worse then 2 grown men flip for the king ( i lose ) . get to the room and notice the sleep number bed ( lucky bastard ) . obviously the interior decorator be a cheesy set designer from a 70 ' s sitcom . tacky go out of style year ago . turn on the 20 inch tube television to catch the news . after get past all the hotel information and pay per view channel i have a whopping 10 whole channel to select from . hey nothing say enjoyment like watch a $ 15 . 00 pay per view movie on a television that the picture be slightly green . never the le my roll away come and i fell quickly asleep . go in the morning and ate at the restaurant downstairs buffet style , no frill . decide i would get a starbucks coffee to go at the cafe in the lobby . i ' m no coffee connoisseur i ' ve probably only have starbucks a couple thousand time . i know what it taste like and this isn ' t it . i should of guess when the clerk pour it in a generic white styrofoam cup . don ' t advertise it if you don ' t sell it . find out the other people at the convention i be at be stay in the same hotel . funny how all of them have their own room and have 2 bed in them . so take note all you front desk out there . ask the guest if he or she want a single or double bed , your hotel just may save me from a sore back . place be in need of remodel and possibly a management change . with so much hotel competition in orlando i would be surprise if it will be able to keep the radisson name .",0,386

"this be easily the worst hotel stay i have ever have . we have a double queen suite . the room do not have a fresh smell upon enter and after sniff out the reason why we discover the couch reeked of urine ! ! i call the operator who send a cleaning man up with a bottle of spray and a towel , he remove the couch cushion and there be a puddle sit on top of the sofa bed , how thorough be the cleaning routine if this slip by the housekeeper ? ! ? a he clean , the entire room fill with a urine smell ! it be absolutely disgust . the front desk say they would see about change our room , and i demand they do so because at this point i didn ' t want to stay in the hotel anymore let alone the urine room . without even an apology the front desk call back and say `` we will send someone up with key for your new room '' . the second room be cleaner , but after that debacle we be already pretty gross out . additionally the shower slowly drain so you be stand in a tub of water by the end of your shower , they do send maintenance to fix this quickly after ask . i pay $ 10 in the business office to print 5 page , with a $ 20 per day resort fee computer usage and printing should be a nominal fee if not complimentary . on our second day at 4pm the housekeeper have not yet arrive , but on checkout day they be knock on our door at 8am , check out time be 11am so there be no reason to have housekeep come to try to rush you out unless they be positive the room have be vacate already . i give 2 star because the pool be nice and have a nice slide , and although there be a lot of people in it we didn ' t feel crowd persay . the lobby decor and ambiance be also misleadingly pretty and well keep .",0,365
"after visit this resort , i can honestly say i ' m not a resort person and so this review be perhaps bias for that reason alone . enormous campus . so be prepare for a lot of walk and wait in line . room be nothing special for the price i pay . the toilet be in the same mildew smelling , un- vented room a the shower , so after use the bathroom you have to touch a doorknob before you wash your hand at the sink locate outside ? that ' s just weird . the sink be on a diagonal which create traffic problem for 3 people beyond belief . . coffee be bad but . . . if you wish to walk a way to the special coffee kiosk at the swan you can wait in line with 20 other people for a $ 6 . 50 latte . smell mildew drawer of the dresser . the handle in the shower knob come off in my husband hand and the sink be plug , but they manage to fix that in a timely manner . the outdoor grotto pool be positively beautiful and well maintain , but the water be very warm and not refresh ( this be july mind you ) during the day hour start at 10am they blast top forty music on the stereo system . . . between that and the ( gorgeous ) waterfall , the noise level be more than i bargain for . ( call me crazy , i just like the sound of the waterfall ) we opt for the lap pool which be quieter . all the restaurant have inflate pricing and so i wasn ' t sure what kind of value i be get for my money . we have a car , and leave for smaller , local eating venue . we be there for the dance competition so this place be not of our choosing . i ' m certain i could find something that suit me better . the kid have fun , but the parent need to as well for the amount of money involve .",0,365
"categorize in my universal orlando guide book a a `` luxury '' hotel , it be the more expensive of the 3 locate on universal ' s property . this hotel definitely have a charm like quality about it a it be suppose to be a replica of portofino , italy . it be say that loewe actually bring in italian artist to paint the facade of the building , which be apparently how it ' s do in portofino . the hotel consist of 3 section of room : west wing , east wing , and villa . our deluxe room face the villa pool have 2 queen size bed and a bathroom with a separate tub and shower and 2 sink . clean , good lighting , friendly hotel staff . the place to eat here , you guess it , be mostly italian ( pizza and pasta ) . the $ 13 large pizza i order from the sal ' s deli downstairs be rather good and be more than enough to fee 2 people . most of the guest use the more popular beach pool while the villa pool be much le congest , which i prefer anyway . the greatest perk of stay at one of the 3 onsite hotel be that be come with a free express pas for each guest , which i love . the free water taxi come about every 15 minute and take a few minute to get to the park . downside : our villa room be quite far from the hotel lobby ( about 3 minute walk and one flight elevator up ) , which be oddly locate on the 3rd floor . this may have be due to our request for quieter room and it do feel more serene have a room with that view . the other downside be that they charge a per day park fee and an internet fee if we want to use internet in out room . luckily , they do provide free wi- fi in their lobby . tip : just remember that stay here really mean visit the 2 universal hotel and city walk .",1,365

"for how much the ticket cost , this theme park be not worth it . even with map , it ' s hard to find the different park with amazing ride . even with fast pas , the line be so long we would miss out . the associate would make u get into the `` regular line. `` yes , some ride be amazing : aerosmith , tower of terror , dinosaur , splash mountain , pirate of the caribbean , etc . but beware a the popular ride have the longest wait time . when ask for direction , the staff have no idea where anything be . to see character there be two line ( just like ride ) which mean fast pas get to see them first . most of the good ride be under maintenance or reconstruction . the water park have limit hour ( different than the park time ) . you have to drive to each park or take a bus and they don ' t come a often a they be suppose to . parking be expensive and a nightmare ! the parade be pathetic a well a the firework show . the park be way too commercialize with restaurant , coffee stand , food cart , etc . i be also under the impression the princess be to be smile all the time and have to talk to all guest , even when go on break . aurora tell u `` go to lunch , you ' ll have to come back later to see me. `` what ? ? almost $ 90 a ticket to get brush off . at least we get to see her . only see donald , pluto , and goofy . no other character . wish it be more simple like disneyland . complete waste of money . at least they have clean bathroom .",1,320
"i stay at this hotel on a business trip to orlando . the hotel itself be a bit dated , but this be a business trip and i know i wouldn ' t be spend much time leisurely hang around the building . on the 3rd day i wake up with what appear to be two small burn on my arm . i start feel dizzy throughout the day and the puncture look like they be get bigger so my coworkers advise me to go to an urgent care . when i do , the doctor immediately recognize it a a brown recluse bite , which he say must have occur no more than 8 hr before ( i would have be sleep ) he give me a topical prescription and say that i be lucky that the bite wasn ' t worse . upon return to the hotel , all that i ask be that my room be move and that the urgent care bill and prescription be cover . they do in fact move my room , however , to a room that overlook the midnight highway construction . the hotel inform me after i leave , that because they couldn ' t find the spider ( which would have be pretty tiny ) in the room , they be unwilling to reimburse me and in no way responsible for the spider bite . i think that this bite definitely could have be a lot worse and i ' m grateful it be pretty minor ( see picture ) . the inconvenience of have to take a half day off during a 5 day business trip to sit in an urgent care and deal with this and then pay almost $ 200 for the visit be unsettle . i would never have even write a negative review if they have just cover the cost of medical treatment .",0,320
"np = 5so i learn one very important lesson while stay at the radisson hotel in lake buena vista . . . and that be that sleep number bed be not comfortable ! i be plan on purchase a new mattress soon and i be between a sleep number bed and a tempurpedic . thanks to my stay at this radisson , i now know which bed i will buy . the reason i say this ( in case you have not pick up on it yet ) be because the bed in this hotel be all sleep number bed . i be very excited about that once i walk into the hotel room but my illusion be burst once it come time to go night night . even if you put the same number on both side of the bed , one still feel a little off more than the other . breakfast be about $ 11 . 99 and it be a continental buffet . however , i recommend save your money ( $ 12 for breakfast ? . . . . pshhh ) and if you can stomach eat at a waffle house , there be one next door . something nice be that there be free parking and you do not have to put a tag on your car to recognize you be stay in the hotel . the hotel be also very close to disney park . more likely than not , if you be stay at this raddison it be because you be go to one of the park . it be a fairly close to the park and the hotel also offer free shuttle service to and from the park . overall , i probably would stay here again if i can get a great deal . other than that , i be not too happy about the sleep number bed .",1,319
"the best way to describe this place be to say it be the same quality hotel/ resort a a high end disney resort . a step above your better hilton/ marriotts but it ' s not a ritz or four season . the most noticeable thing about the place be the staff . from valet to registration desk to random clean staff you encounter throughout the place , everyone be downright friendly and helpful . the service be fantastic . the room be fine . i be upgrade to a deluxe suite ( thank you marriott gold ) but visit a standard guest room and their top end suit too . all of them meet or exceed expectation . so there be one glare blemish on the resort - the restaurant . be they bad ? no it ' s just that they be overprice - by vacation resort standard - for the quality you get . we have a group dinner approx 12- 15 one night at the steakhouse . the food be decent and the service be great but not even close to be worth the price ( see my other review and you ' ll notice that i ' m ok with a very expensive dinner ) . best analogy be that it ' s not quite the quality of capitol grille but charge shula price ( which be at the nearby dolphin/ swan ) . i ate at the sushi restaurant and the coffee bean . the former be a more enjoyable and more reasonably price experience . the coffee bean be so bad and overprice that i write a separate review . would i stay at the hotel again - yes , but only if i wasn ' t go to disney or universal a the on site property be at least a good and offer immeasurable benefit the gaylord can ' t .",1,319
"this be not a 4- star resort . the ground be lovely , the room be filthy and the staff be unfriendly and unaccommodating . we book this hotel in august for our trip , the day after christmas . we request early check in and be tell that would be fine . we call twice before board the plane to confirm the reservation and to make sure the room and early check in be still available , we be assure they be . long story short , after 9 hour of travel on the red eye , it take 5 hour to check in to the hotel . it be a very busy weekend , they be sell out but it didn ' t seem to be an issue for guest without reservation to check in a early a 3 hour before we be able to . while wait in the parking lot for our room to become available , we observe 3 other guest with similar circumstance also wait . we all go inside and stand adjacent to the check in desk , those with discount reservation be not give room , while guest pay full price be . once give a room , it wasn ' t clean . there be toothpaste and hair in the sink . leftover in the refrigerator , hair and soap in the shower and one of the two full size bed be cover in food crumb both on the comforter and in the sheet . btw , we reserve a smoking room with a king size bed . the couple who ask for a non smoking room with two bed with a two year old get the smoking room with one bed , we get the non smoking with two bed . i will never stay here again , it be a very bad way to start a vacation .",0,319
"this place use to be pretty decent . a few year back they have a similar name to a marriott brand of property and since we ' ve be back to the area , i ' ve just realize that their name have change . they appear to be do just a many reno on the property a they be last year though . the place itself have go down hill . the room be stock with bare bone , basic . there be no extra . the room be a decent size , although a little narrow , but allow for privacy ( think residence inn style layout , with a closed door in between ) if travel with child or even another couple . however the room aren ' t well stock . our room slept at least 4 and be stock with only 1 set of towel - accommodate 2 guest . there be no sheet or blanket for the pull out bed . when we request extra sheet they be never deliver . thankfully there be a cart of clean linen near our room to snag some to use . any extra supply have to be check out from the front desk . my husband go to the desk one morning right when the office open , the staff member cuss up a storm at his request . they be unfriendly and unaccommodating . the overall cleanliness be below average . there be dust bunny in all of the corner and the baseboard be dirty . the fixture be lose and rattle . be careful of the switch next to the kitchen counter that appear to be a light switch . . . that ' s the garbage disposal , which be conveniently locate low so my small child could turn it on ! definitely leave room for improvement for hotel in this area .",0,319
"like most reviewer of the disney value resort i find myself follow suit and say that you can not expect the lavish accomodations that you could receive if you could afford them . for a family that spend very little time at the resort this be the perfect place because you have the essential . bed and a bathroom . if you be travel with relative , let them know what they be in for . this be not a quiet resort by any standard , the post ' quiet hour ' request be ignore because of many reason which one of my relative kindly point out be probably because the teenager that be stay here can not read them anyway . i love stay at the all- star resort for three reason ; the overly elaborate building , the food court that allow you to sit and watch tv and get unlimited refill ( until midnight ) for hour after return from the park for the evening , and the value price to stay on property for those that visit disney for the park not the resort . all three of these be ruin for me by my traveling companion because of complaining or ridcule of the core thing i enjoy . have a resort refer to a our nightly prison cell do not make me happy . for those visit disney world for the park and all there be outside of the resort , the all- star resort be the perfect answer . for those that want to soak up either some ray or some atmosphere , do not stay at the all- star , i would personally suggest the boardwalk villa . if you be like me and be a vacation warrior , get up early and go to bed late , the all- star be the resort of choice and the best solution .",1,318

"worst conference location i have ever be to . no wifi for anyone except the guest of the hotel , which i admit be our organization ' s decision not to purchase , but there be no reason that it have to be so expensive that one of the largest social science organization couldn ' t afford it . the food be terrible , overprice , and severely severely lack in vegetable . not only be there not a single vegetarian option at any of the restaurant in the hotel , but even the carnivorous dish lack enough vegetable . everyone i know leave feel nutritionally deprive by the end . the lack of coffee shop be equally awful for an academic conference . no latte , no mocha , very little caffeine to be have . it ' s isolate , and disconnect from nearly everything else . so i stay at a different disney hotel , but in order to get here , i have to take a bus , cross the hollywood park , then take a ferry across the lagoon to get to this hotel . not the greatest commute in heel and professional clothing . one of the best part of any conference be the socializing over drink after a long day of sessions- - there be such limited option here , so they fill up completely start around 3 : 00 pm and they ' re all very expensive . i would never recommend this venue for any conference , ever- - somewhere in downtown orlando must be fifty time better . if they serve any vegetable at all , it ' s get to be at least that much more bearable . if there ' s a bar that you don ' t have to take a lagoon ferry to get to , it could even be enjoyable !",0,316

( alchohol wasn ' t include for breakfast . only the standard juice/ tea/ coffee ) . unfortunately we didn ' t get to enjoy the breakfast because we be out each day during the dinner time but it be wonderful to know the offer be there . the room be spacious enough but not huge . with 7 people in a room we didn ' t feel crowd . the reason i give 4 star be because the master bedroom have a queen bed instead of a king and the room could stand to be about 1 foot wider for convenience . also we have one sofabed instead of the 2 we anticipate and that sofabed be more comfortable at a sofa for sleep than a a bed . lastly the pool light turn off about 10 : 30 but turn on the light to the fitness center provide adequate light . overall it be a great stay . many store in walk distance just behind the hotel on international drive . we would definitely stay here again .",1,315

"a i haven ' t write many review to date , let me preface this review by say that i think star rating should be base on whether you get what you pay for . i don ' t think an airport hotel you pay $ 50 for should be rat low because you be expect a high class suite . that be say i would stay at this hotel again in a heart beat . i book this room for $ 58 on expedia a couple night in advance . we book their basic king suite , and be pleasantly surprise . the room be very clean and the bed be very comfortable . the suite be set up like a mini studio with an office desk and lounge area next to a small dining table and kitchenette . the bathroom be update with nice stone tile . we be fly into orlando for a cruise and take advantage of their free airport shuttle . the bus and minivan use for transportation have see better day but the drive staff be pleasant and help up set up reasonably price transportation to the port the following day . the room come with a free continental breakfast in the morning . when i think of continental breakfast i typically think of croissant , muffin and orange juice . the breakfast we get consist of croissant , bagel , cereal , belgium waffle , egg , sausage , bacon , and more . amazing ! the hotel itself be in an airport area so other than more hotel and chain restaurant there isn ' t much else in the area . we have pizza deliver from one of the hotel recommend location and be very happy . so all in all , a great hotel that surpass all expectation for the night .",1,311
"the staff be very pleasant and responsive to whatever we need . the hotel seem to be very well staff . room be clean . good size room and kitchenette . enjoy the pool and arcade . bartender be good and responsive . disney shuttle come around every 30 minute or so . once on the shuttle it ' s about a 30- 40 ride to the park , so plan accordingly . the hotel advertise that it ' s within walk distance of downtown disney , but it really isn ' t. it ' s about a five minute drive which seem safer and quicker than wait for a shuttle or walking . parking at downtown disney be free . the price would be good if you didn ' t have to pay for parking and internet each day . there be no free meal and the dining area be over- price compare to other option . there be ton of other eat option within a 2 minute drive . there be a per- day park fee and per device wireless internet fee of $ 10 per day . not much of a selection in the bar and din area . very frustrated that there be no cat5 port for wired internet connection , so you ' re require to use wireless . also , the tv ' s be lock so that you can not use a hdmi device , so our family be there for nine day and only have limit television option . that ' s the main reason we ' ll not return to this hotel , a it ' s not very tech friendly . if you ' re not a very tech friendly family , than this be probably closer to a 3 on the scale and may work just fine for you .",0,311
my fiance and i stay here for race weekend and expect it to be not high quality and even expect the room to look old etc . we be not even surprise when we saw the shower with dirt and hair in it . ( i clean before shower ) . i just laugh it off an say to myself ok next time i will pay the extra to get a nicer hotel . what do shock me be the following . i be check in and prepay until monday . my ipad be take from the room . when i call security they say they do not have it and be question if i even bring one . it wasn ' t until i call the police and tell them about the track information on it that it be magically find . i get the craziest run around by security for an explanation and be never contact the following day . the service be disgust to say the least . we receive 3 different story on how my ipad from the room i be check into end up across property in the security office . i call the gm after return home to tell her what have happen and she promise to call me back . i tell her i really do not want to speak to security again since my issue be with them . the gm set a poor example because she have security call me back at 10 something at night to my home number . the gm nor the deputy never call me to follow up like promise . i guess it be too much for me to expect a level of costumer service from upper management . hotel be a disgrace .

worst experience ever ! sad because we have stay here before . we make reservation for our stay at the of october back in september . when we arrive at first they say we have a different check in and our reservation be cancel . which be incorrect . they then find u room ! they place over $ 900 of hold on our credit card throughout the weekend with no reason . we sense that there be a too much confusion and that checkout would be a mess . well we guess correctly . our check- out be a 3 hour fiasco ! charge for valet that we didn ' t use and who know what else . and then they couldn ' t even find my original charge from early september . thankfully i have them . finally after much wait they figure something out and say we be fine and charge be make to a relative that be pay for second night . they issue a $ 0 balance receipt and we leave . the person in charge of help u give u their email and number to reach them for any concern that may arise . well hold and behold- 5 day later they charge my credit card for charge ? ! ? double charge ! ! i call and email the individual they finally call back and the they say they would check charge on their end and call me back . it ' s be over a week and nothing . i even email them say if they don ' t reverse those charge i be dispute them with my bank . i call again today to speak to the general manager and be await a return call ! i ' m do ! !,0,301

"this be an awful place to stay . my friend and i stay here because it be cheap and the website be beautiful . the picture make it look like a dream . while it be very close to disney world there weren ' t enough shuttle to the park . the shuttle also leave at odd time . there be no shuttle back when the park close . the shuttle to universal got u there about thirty minute before it open . the hotel look nothing like the picture . while the picture be light and beautiful , this hotel be old , rundown and dirty . i would say it look more like an off the road motel than a hotel you would want to stay in for five day . the first room stank of mold , it be so bad that we have to change room . the second room do not stink , and be clean , but not clean by the standard you expect from a hotel . i make sure to wear shower shoe and never walk on the carpet or in the bathroom/ shower without show . i also cover the toilet seat before sit because it just didn ' t seem clean . the tub also do not work properly and there be rust on the door , and layer of dust on all the baseboard . while it be cheap it be not worth it at all . i would rather have pay more and be comfortable than worried of lay in a dirty bed . the most upsetting thing be how much their hotel be unlike their website and how much we felt lie to . the wifi be free but barely work .",0,295
"i will give it a low low two . . . people run the counter be nice , but that ' s about it . we come up because we have a dinner show down the block and didn ' t want to spend a boat load on a hotel . kinda regret that decision now , i feel poorer from stay there ! the howard johnson be now call the m hotel orlando and they now have a glbt night club at the hotel , which we didn ' t know prior to book , not that there be anything wrong with that just not for u . do want we didn ' t hear nor see anyone near or at the nightclub and we be there on a friday night . our room be just crappy . walk in and smelt like a bar , smell of smoke be horrible ! i have asthma and hop i don ' t get sick from it . the hotel be very run down and about to fall apart . bed be comfy but pretty much sink in and break . plus for stuff just keep fall out . alarm clock didn ' t work . no coffee pot ( glass part ) for the coffee pot . don ' t try to check out before 7am , they be not open until then . they have an emergency number to the girl who come in the morning . yeah , we don ' t recommend stay here at all , the other review be true ! felt bad for the family with the two little kid , really want to take them and stick them in a nice disney hotel for a few day .",0,295

i be not please at all . first of all i be a starwood preferred guest member and because we book through costco i do not get point for my stay . ridiculous and aggrevating since starwood get my money yet i get no point . we have three room during our stay at the disney dolphin hotel from 9/ 20/ 2014 through 9/ 27/ 2014. our room be damp to the point our clothing and sheet be wet every day . after read through some of the other review i see we be not alone in that ! the lounge chair at the pool be the most uncomfortable i ' ve ever experience ! they be hard a a rock and too low to the ground . on the upside the spa be amaze - i have 3 massage during my visit and be please . the bar at the pool have the best pina coladas ! unfortunatelt that ' s about it for the positive ! i call to complain about these issue and be offer nothing but an sorry that ' s our policy and sorry you weren ' t happy . sorry do nothing for me and what happen to the day when a manager take control and say - i ' m go to make this right ! wouldn ' t that make sense instead of lose a customer ? a a consumer i have choice and due to the above mention issue i will choose in the future to stay anywhere but a starwood hotel . it ' s a shame that spending that much money do not provide me with the quality i expect nor do i feel appreciate a a customer . big mistake starwood !,0,294
"call this place a `` resort '' be definitely a stretch . while not horrible , this place could definitely use some extra tlc . at first glance , the room look update but once you get into the bathroom , that ' s pretty much where the update stop . the room be clean decently , definitely not up to my personal standard but it be doable for a few day . the bathroom on the other hand , be clean poorly ! the shower curtain be absolutely disgust and mildew . it be so gross that we never even touch it and keep the shower open basically every time we use it . do this get the floor wet a few time but oh well ! they should ' ve replace that nasty curtain ! another thing that bother me be the old and tattered towel they provide . both the pool and room towel be flimsy and ragged . we need to use several to dry off . it be evident they hadn ' t be replace in year . also , the towel in our room be not replenish everyday so we have to request towel every time we want to shower . thank goodness for the awesome pool area and cafe area ; which i ' d say be the best thing about avanti . surprisingly the cafe food taste pretty good and be moderately price . i also enjoy their staff . everyone i interact with be super friendly and be always smile . this be not a horrible experience ( again , thank god for the pool area ) but i definitely wouldn ' t stay here again . update be need and cleanliness be lack .",1,294

"please don ' t make me go back . i stay at the swan for a conference . here be the highlight : pros- - room be large- water be provide every day- staff be very friendly and helpfulcons- if you don ' t have a car - you be strand . there be not a non- disney place within walk distance ( and i walk far ) . to get to the closest non- disney restaurant , prepare to pay over $ 20 for a taxi . - the fan in the bathroom didn ' t work which add to the ample humidity from a florida summer . ( at least i get a free sauna in my room - joking of course ) - swan and dolphin be not prepare for a conference of any size- half of the restaurant be not open for lunch ( over 8000 of my closest friend and i want lunch and it be a battle ) - restaurant that be open be understaffed . line be out the door . - food be terrible and expensive . 6 day and not one good meal . - one place to buy coffee per hotel ? and a line of 20 people ? and one cashier ? talk about grumpy conference attendee . - surprisingly little disney merchandise . i couldn ' t go into the park due to time constraint , but didn ' t find anything worth take home in the shop . even the bigger one on the boardwalk .

"this hotel/ resort be by far the largest/ fanciest hotel that my wife and i have ever stay at ( at least a far back a i can remember ) . the view from our room ( 11th floor ) be amaze . it probably go without say but i ' ll mention it anyway , this be not the place to go if you ' re on a tight budget , look to pinch penny , or want a cozy quiet little place . this hotel be for those look for some place grandiose & amp ; luxurious . we opt for self parking , but would highly recommend use their valet service a it be a loooong walk ( up hill ) from the self parking lot to the lobby . we find our room to be very clean and the bed be extremely comfortable . we have difficulty exit the parking lot around dinner time and find ourselves in stand still traffic within the resort itself , so that be something to look out for . the pool be open until midnight , something i really appreciate a there be few thing better than a late night swim . we love the fact that there be restaurant on property that be open past midnight and we find the marketplace in the lower lobby to be surprisingly affordable . ( $ 9 hot wing & amp ; $ 6 load chili fry ! ) . we will definitely return if we ever strike it rich or be lucky enough to win/ receive a gift certificate again . thanks for a great stay .

"i ' ll first start off by say that i actually want to stay at the residence inn but i be try to stay at the government price and this one be the nearest , right next to it , that provide the price i be look for . walk into the building it be very open and inviting , the front desk be off to the left side and you actually have to look for it to check in . the front staff be very friendly and be fast and efficient . really , this be not abnormal for most marriott hotel so the staff here be pretty normal compare to others . they get me a room on the 3rd floor and at that point i really didn ' t care where i stay a long a there be a pillow . they place me in one of the end room and i actually like it there so i only have really one neighbor and hardly hear anyone my entire stay . the breakfast during my stay be pretty normal with marriott other than the staff that be work it be very friendly to others . the seat around the area be good but there could have be more or better placement of the tv ' s so that we all could watch the news in the morning when it be busy . one of the complaint that i do have be that when there be a special event go on and people be not stay at the hotel the parking can be an issue for some . overall , pretty normal marriott and the reason that i like to stay with them , consistent .",1,288
"during my internship program at walt disney world , i would frequently hear story from my guest about the delightful caribbean beach resort . despite the cbr be a part of the ' moderate ' hotel category , the resort be the top destination of choice for myriad family and couple . i decide to try the caribbean beach resort on my last visit to walt disney world . unfortunately , i be far from impress . the biggest problem with the cbr be it size - easily the largest resort in the wdw collection , building be sprawl around a two- mile circular track . the resort be so gargantuan that an inner- resort shuttle be provide to shepherd guest around the property . on to the amenity . . . our room be small and run- down with an awkward closet- size bathroom . definitely unacceptable for the price . smaller pool be cluster around the resort , but i could not find a single jacuzzi . additionally , there be no gym here . . . how can that be the case ? i have never stay at a hotel - let alone a resort - that do not offer a gym . i guess disney figure that it guest will be too tire from the park , but i would have like to have it available . bottom line : i would not choose to go back to this resort . in the moderate category , choice like port orleans and old key west be far superior to the cbr . when i return to orlando , i ' ll spend the extra money to stay at wilderness lodge or animal kingdom lodge .",0,288

"recently stay at this hotel for a meeting , and i have to say that i would not recommend this place at all . the reason i ' m give this place two star instead of one , be that the bed be comfy , i love their chocolate chip cookies that you get when checking in , and the waitstaff be friendly . here be the reason that i didn ' t like the place : * i have to wait close to 45 minute to be pick up at the airport . i have to call twice , and when the guy do arrive , he barely acknowledge me ( no greeting ) , just toss my bag on the van . * the front desk person again do not greet me when i arrive , which i think be standard practice at most hotel , or maybe just the hotel that i ' m use to . * meeting room be really small and they only have a single bathroom next to our meeting room ( which i thought be really weird for a large hotel ) . if that be occupy , then you have to walk through the lobby and find the only other bathroom which have two stall . really inconvenient and why so few bathroom ? * wall be really thin - i could hear an entire conversation next door , and they weren ' t yelling . thank goodness they didn ' t talk all night . i guess if you need your hilton point and want to stay near the airport , that ' s up to you , but i ' m just not a fan .",0,287
"1 star be too generous ! ! ! ! ! so where to begin . . . . . . let ' s start with the rude and unhelpful front desk . despite the placard in the room that state if you need anything , just ask , that so simply not the case at all . especially if that lone request be simply for a bottle of water ! i have to basically threaten to call a manager just to get a bottle of water at 11pm . likewise , when you circle the impossibly small parking lot desperately seek a spot and even after you pull up and tell the front desk that all space be fill , if you happen to park near their construction dumpster , you will receive a rude and unhelpful call at 11 pm force you to come down and move your car . . . . . . 1 spot over ! the food service be non existent a well , but i could look past that if only one of the people run this place exhibit even 1 iota of customer concern or care . we spend a lot of money with the holiday inn chain a an organization and this experience have certainly put an end to that . what happen to the notion of good service and positive people at a fair price ? those be the good old day , i suppose . also just a an fyi the wifi here be terrible - basically unusable for anything . . . . at all . anyway with so many other option in orlando , please do yourself a favor and pick a different chain .",0,287
"2 star for the price and convenience a far a get to the park . but man i be not a fan of this place ! the hotel be not `` disgust '' by my standard , just uncomfortable . . . - the lobby be nice i will give them that , they do a great job with the remodel ( i ' ve stop here once before ) but the room should be what they be remodel here ! - the entire room just felt wet . our sheet , pillow , and bed felt wet and soggy , every piece of paper look moldy from be wet . it be just weird ! - the bathroom door keep jam on u to the point where we say screw privacy i don ' t wan na get stick in here so we keep it open while do our business - the bathtub have all kind of hair in it , i skip shower during our stay . - the curtain do not close ! we be set up on the 2nd floor right next to the parking lot/ street light and they be come right through the window the entire night . not to mention all of the people hang around the hallway could see right into our room . - the pillow on the bed be like tiny couch throw pillow positive like i say , it ' s cheap . we pay $ 28/ night to stay here ( although after tax & amp ; `` resort '' fee it be closer to $ 40 ) and they have shuttles/ be locate close to disney where we spend most of our time .",0,287
"such a quaint and charm little place . i go for brunch and sat on the terrace . the view be absolutely spectacular and that alone be worth the trek out to mount dora . they have a wonderful mimosa special for brunch , it be $ 6 for a single mimosa or $ 7 for bottomless mimosa . . . the bottomless choice be a no brainer . they have a serious yellow jacket issue on the terrace . we be constantly be bother by them which mean i spend the entire brunch in and out of my seat run away from the threat of be stung . we have 3 yellow jacket go for a swim in our mimosa ( thank goodness we go with the bottomless ) . the service staff be entirely unfazed by this . the food be decent . i order a chicken caesar salad and my recommendation be that anyone get a salad get dress on the side here . the salad be absolutely swim in dressing , and come from someone that like a heavy pour of dress that say a lot . i take one bite and couldn ' t handle it . i end up only eat the chicken and crouton and no one ask if something be wrong a they take away my full plate of salad . i be still hungry when i leave , which be disappoint . everyone else in my group be happy with their meal so i assume i have a one off experience . the staff be friendly and give the stunning view , i will return . i will just not get a salad on my next visit .",0,287
"ok so where can i start with this hotel . . it be so close to be horrible . the hotel itself have a run down parking lot that ' s so dirty and trashy , the hotel look ok on the outside but there ' s evidence of not be well care for and clean regularly . the room themselves be relatively nice for a budget hotel , but there be a few thing beneath that . the design of some of the room and furniture be a bit out date , there be ant in our room , and many of the appliance and essential didn ' t work a well a expect . the wifi be absolutely horrendous ! for a family who do most of there school and work online and need to have internet at the time , this be really disappointing and frustrating . we couldn ' t connect most of our device and it keep drop signal , and when we could connect it be horribly slow . when we try ask the hotel about they say they be have `` issue '' and there be nothing they could really do about it . ( keep in mind we be there for four day and it never improve despite our complaint ) also probably the worst issue be all of the rough people hang around and the hotel security and police do handle it a couple of time , but there be many time in the evening and at night we would hear disturbance and thing that seem unsafe . i certainly do not recommend this hotel , and i hope they make many change in the future .",0,286
"this be one of those time that i wish i could give half star in which case it would really be 2 1/ 2 star . the lobby be nice , staff be friendly . the pool outside look invite though , it be rainy and too cold to swim while we stay . my biggest complaint be the room . they be in serious need of upgrading and deep cleaning . the bathroom be really show their age . the granite countertop be chip in place . the cabinet be also chip and in need of replace or refinish . the carpet look like it hasn ' t be change since the 80 and the paint be horrible in place . not sure if there be blood on the wall in the bathroom or some other red liquid that splash and no one ever clean . the best part of our stay be the location . we easily walk to universal and island of adventure within 15 minute . there be a shuttle but , it come infrequently . we only make the shuttle once but , they do mention they have return shuttle service 3 time after 4 pm . a cab be only $ 5. the hotel have a tgi fridays attach . within half a mile ( walk distance ) we find carraba ' s , kobe japanese/ sushi , orlando ale house , walgreens and a good hole in the wall mexican place call border grill . overall , if you don ' t mind stay in outdated room and/ or be try to save a few buck , the holiday inn be a good choice because of the location .",1,286

"this be a top notch hotel ! i stay here for 8 night for a conference . the room be well appoint , the onsite restaurant option be numerous , and the hotel itself be very classy , elegant , and invite . there be many room with a view of the pool and surround attraction , but there be some room that have a view of the flat florida landscape . regardless of your room view , i be certain that you will feel right at home in these large room with spacious bathroom . if you be here for a convention , a i be , there be a sky bridge that connect you to the two convention building . there be cover walkway so you don ' t need to worry about the rain or frequent summer lightning storm . the north convention center be closest , but if your event take place in the west convention center you can still walk to it , it lengthen the walk by a bit , but it still be a very easy and comfortable walk ( i could make it in 10- 15 minute at a casual pace ) . if you be here for fun , all of the major amusement park be easily within a short cab or uber ride away . i use uber and it be way cheaper than many of my friend who use a taxi to go to the same place . there be also ample restaurant in the surround area that you can walk to , or again take a cab or uber to .",1,273
"this be a surprise to me , i totally didn ' t remember see this place two year ago when i go , but then again i didn ' t get into cigar till after that trip , so now i can fully appreciate this sosa fuente cigar company . it have a great feel to it , a little tight , you can fit maybe 10 people max in the store , but the staff be really cool , and it always make me feel good when i see the worker walkin around with cigar in their pocket . for those on the west coast , sosa family cigar co. be comparable to fuente cigar in la vega ' caesar ' s palace or like the big easy , but without a smoking place . that ' s why i knock it down a star because there wasn ' t a place to sit and relax to enjoy a smoke . well there be a couple of chair , but nothing like big easy or fuente , and it the seat be take up by two kid . . . . so , that ' s disney for ya . anyhoo , still a great place to get a smoke , and the people be really cool . so , if you ' re in the orlando area and the family want disney and you want a cigar . . . . . leave the kid by the ghirardelli soda fountain shop and enjoy a cigar from the sosa family on your way to meet them by the lego dragon .",1,272
"this place have several large flaw that make the stay unusual . the biggest problem be that during the 4 night stay there be no hot water . i don ' t understand how a lowes establishment can not provide the basic requirement of a hotel . when we call a spoke with the front desk , we be give a run- around . secondly , on sunday late afternoon we go to the pool and a soon a we get there , the life guard close the pool . i notice the pool be fill with child include baby in diaper . i know for a fact that baby who aren ' t potty train be not allow into public pool . there be 3 life guard on duty and not one notice until it be too late . then we go into the jacuzzi where it be comfortable 104 degree and several people enjoy it but within 10 min 5 kid 10years of age and under jump into the jacuzzi . they be disturb the other guest enjoy the amenity and i state to the kid that the sign say kid must be 12 year of age or older to be in the pool because it be state wide health code issue ( the high heat can kill child ) . again the life guard fail to do anything . finally , check out we be not provide a itemized bill even though we ask for it because the reservation be make with universal instead of the lowes hotel ( it bewilder me how there system be not intergraded )",0,272

"i be extremely dissapointed . i book a king bed suite , that include a sofa bed , upon arrival i be tell it be not available and all they have be a double bed suite . how can you take someone money upon book and not have what they pay for available . the room smell very humid , the bathroom have hair on the roof from past visitor , no sheet in th e room , etc . . . the picture in the website be just to reel you in . it do have a nice pool and that ' s about it . park in the place be horrible , i have parking but i do see where they be talling people there be no more parking space and they have to park outside the location . it be in serious need of renovation . never again will i stay here . i ask the front desk for more blanket and practically have to wait a little over an hour to receive them . some of the elevator do not work . at time the door of the room wouldn ' t even close appropriately . in addition they have this long list they make you initial and sign , state all the thing they be not responsible if steal . i have never have to do this before and make me wonder how many time their staff have steal item from peo people before . your better off pay le at any other hotel and get better rooms/ hotel than this .",0,267

"thank you for your reply ryan , but you misunderstand , i do not book a room , marriott vacation club invite me and book the room . yes , the facility be clean and i understand that the first room be unusual and i ' m sure it will be address , but it be the reaction to the issue that be upset . you see , because of the 2- 300 night a year i spend in marriott property , i expect better . i ' ve see better . marriott to me be more than the room , it be the service and attitude of the staff and attention to detail . it be about me have only to worry about my destination and the business that i be do and marriott people take care of the rest . for example , i have a skin reaction to feather pillow , i request foam , i don ' t like low floor because of the noise , i request high floor . it ' s all in my profile . neither do i receive , nor be it ever mention that anyone have even check my profile . these be the thing that need to be address and put marriott above all other chain . this be why i be willing to look at buying . this be why you aren ' t ready for me yet .",0,241

( the non- stop disney video play on the bus be annoy , but to be expect and at least keep the kid quiet on the ride ! ) extra star for prove h2o+ bath product - my favorite ! for someone who would never willingly go to disney for vacation , i enjoy my two night stay here .",1,234

"not the greatest hilton property and it could surely use an upgrade . the location be convenient across the street and about a half block from the entrance to downtown disney . contrary to what one reviewer write on here in a rather dubious sound review , it be easy to walk from the hotel to the downtown disney area via the pathway on the backside of the hotel near the pool . the disney traffic system account for pedestrian cross the street by stop all traffic in all direction , allow easy and safe passage across the street for hotel guest . pay the reviewer who write this no mind , because it be a lie that one can not walk to downtown disney from this hotel . the breakfast they offer to gold/ diamond member be pretty much a joke . . . just coffee , cold cereal , and some sweet roll . nothing like the full breakfast that most hiltons offer . and the coffee shop charge $ 20 for a breakfast buffet . . . lol , now that be a ripoff . good place to stay if you want convenience for get to downtown disney for a decent rate . go over to the earl of sandwich for a good buy on a breakfast sandwich and skip the hotel offering .",1,227

normally i would write a review on the i hg website but since this hotel have completely screw up my folio i be force to go on yelp and give the review that be due . a last- minute change cause u to take room in this hotel at check- in they could not divide up our room and apparently one of my coworkers name be on all three of our reservation instead of mind which make the reservation . call today to clarify thing i be put on hold and then eventually drop so i call from a second phone and finally get a hold of the manager i explain the situation to the manager it wasn ' t until 20 minute into our conversation that i even get anything remotely like an apology . i give him to email address and it ' s be well over an hour still haven ' t get the folio to one of the email . apparently these people have a lot of work to do when it come to paperwork and people skill and customer service . i mention the bad smell upon check out to the morning clerk at the front desk . travel all the time and i run into really good and really bad this be really bad .,0,221

"locate at a 20 min drive from airport , doubletree be a great hotel for business traveler and family . i stay here few month back when i be in orlando for a conference . this place be huge and divide into a different section . they have villa style hotel room , there be restaurant also on the property . they go through a recent makeover which show and the overall the hotel look great . they be now an official on- site seaworld partner hotel . they be conveniently locate adjacent to seaworld and it water park aquatica and we ' re also just minute away from the other main attraction ( universal orlando resort , walt disney world ® resort theme park , the orange county convention center ) . the check in process be smooth . the room be nice not overly lavish but they do serve the purpose . i be here for 3 day , since my conference be inside the hotel i be able to see and experience the service in the conference room . the staff be helpful and courteous . their in- house restaurant where we have breakfast be just ok , i be expect better food and service there . overall staying at this hotel be a pleasant experience .",1,220
"fun atmosphere ! clean , colorful and beautiful set around the lake . please keep in mind , this be one of disney ' s moderate resort so don ' t start compare it to the grand floridian or the boardwalk , it ' s not the same . the only con to stay here be that the place be huge and there be a lot of building and bus stop and the food court be most likely a fairly long walk from your room . we stay here for the wdw 2013 marathon weekend and it be a great location because it ' s not too far from the start line or finish line . our room be clean and really nice with `` find nemo '' comforter ! ( cute touch ) . the food court be okay , they be all the same no matter which hotel you ' re at - they all have the same `` quick service '' food . it ' s not great , just okay . the lake and pool area be really pretty - you will def . enjoy the scenery . it ' s gorgeous . i would def . stay here again - it ' s a great price point for what you get on disney property !",1,220
we be promise a free upgrade and when we get there it didn ' t happen . the city area be run down and dirty . not close to anything so you have to take a bus or taxi to get around . we get his hotel because of it ' s closeness to universal studio . the free shuttle that be offer only come once in the morning and then once when the park close . didn ' t like that . we be just not happy with the location and the hotel ' s promise unfulfilled . we cancel our reservation after one night and go back to the buenna vista palace locate inside the disney park . it be so much nicer and cleaner . they give u a break on the price after talk to the manager . i think he just felt bad for u . we be so much happier go back to the buena vista which also offer shuttle to universal for $ 18 round trip . don ' t believe the review that they have on their website . obviously they ' re only gon na show the positive review during their video . not the worst place i ' ve be to but i wouldn ' t stay there again .,0,220

"the only good thing about this hotel be the proximity to sea world and the shuttle . we stay here 5 night and that be by far way too many . so many thing to list here . first off the door on these room and i do mean all of the room slam shut , so don ' t plan on get much sleep . we sleep with a fan on and all we could hear be slam door and scream kid . the room itself be not very dirty , but the hotel hallway and elevator be disgust . they be not vacuum the entire 5 night we be here and we know this by the band aid that remain on the floor every day . the maid be all rude . i ask for towel instead of service and then tip them and never receive a thank you . and the last and by far the worst complaint be after we check out my daughter notice a rash on her arm and leg . after get back from vacation and go to the doctor it be confirm it be bug bite . i be shock this place receive anything over 3 for guest rating . i would never return and be highly reconsider my marriott loyalty .",0,220
"we be there for a short family vacation , 2 night . i be a little disappointed with the smell in the room . . musty . . i book via ( get it half price ) , so i get the best available at the time of check in , they be go to give u 2 double bed , but luckily they have a king available . yay ! we be travel with an infant , so we ask for a crib . when they bring it , it be dirty . . . like a kid vomit in it . . they bring u a new one , when ask asap . in house coffee be pretty bad , i end up just dump it out . . toiletry be lovely . room have fridge . there be no channel guide , person at front desk be not very helpful when i ask which channel be the disney channel for my daughter . . very close to downtown disney , they be not joke when they say 5 min walk . it be very close . free shuttle that leave every 30 min , all day , every day , which be really nice ! over all nice property , i ' d stay there again .",0,220
"first let me say the staff be friendly and professional and the location be close to the main orlando attraction . those be the main positive of this residence inn . first they mess up our reservation ( make through the marriott website not a secondary travel site ) . we receive the 2 bedroom suite a order but both room have 2 queen instead of 2 queen and 1 king . the queen bed be very soft and when both of u lay on the bed we really sink to the middle . so my wife and i spend 3 night in separate bed . the whole suite be date but not horrible . the air conditioner be in a closet in the bedroom and be pretty noisy . there be a few little annoyance like a clock that didn ' t work , tv remote that be very finicky and a fridge that be turn all the way up that it freeze many of our item . the breakfast buffet be good . nice variety of breakfast fare . have a large din area with lot of seat . it be surprise and disappointing how much disposal ware they use . utensil , cup ( plastic and styrofoam ) and some of the plate be all garbage .",0,220
"i haven ' t be to magic kingdom for about 20 year and it appear that the equipment hasn ' t be update since then . the parking lot be so far away from the actual park ( can only get there by tram or ferry ) that you waste 30 minute of your day , each way , get in and out of the park . it take my group 5 hour to go on 5 attraction ( that ' s a rate of $ 20 per ride ) and 3 of the 5 ride have `` technical difficulty '' and we be either stall on the ride ( twice on the haunt mansion ) , be force to wait almost 45 minute for a show that be schedule to begin in 12 minute and have to re- watch the same skit twice on another attraction . we go to the `` disney bakery '' on main street just to find out it be starbucks . all in all a very disappointing experience and hardly worth the $ 105 admission . the height of greediness be they also charge $ 17 to park . unless you have real small child who want to meet the disney character , universal studio be definitely more bang for your buck .",0,219
"well well well . . . no word can really describe how much of a let down this place really be ! 1st of all let ' s jus say the picture on their web page must have be of a different resort because the one i walk into be closer to be a motel 8 which would have be cool if i have pay motel 8 price ! the pool area be decent the ground could be more well keep and maintenance be null and void broken gate , paint chip everywhere old dingy laundry room have more spider web and lint then i could describe . our room be out of the 1990 ' s half workable tv screen and the mattress seem to big for the box spring , which make a a funny joke when ever anyone try to sit on the edge ! the bathroom be hilariously disgust we make sure flip flop stay on in the shower and to top it off our car get break into the 2nd night there and of course there be no work camera on our side ( build a ) let ' s just say it be the worst stay in orlando ever and will never make the mistake of not book at our usual place !",0,219
"oh my ! this place turn out way better than i have imagine . i stay here with my beau and his family for a few day on a fun orlando vacation . we share a 3 bedroom condo with a massive living area , kitchen , bathroom in every bedroom , and everything you could want for a long- ish stay ! they really have think of everything - kitchen be stock with all the amenity , there be a laundry room downstairs and plenty of closet space . honestly , i wish we have stay longer . there ' s a great pool , hot tub and arcade area over by the main office , a well a a gym . love that the complex be just minute away from everything - the park , the convention center , restaurant . there ' s a publix within walk distance so you can stock up on all your favorite stuff while you stay ! there be a bit of an ant situation outside the front door when we arrive , but one call to the office have them spray our unit down in no- time . can ' t say enough good thing about vista cay ; definitely check it out for your next stay in orlando .",1,219
"a great location , but not much else . the hotel isn ' t terrible , but it be in need of some renovation . the room be ok , and i wasn ' t expect much , because radisson be a budget type chain . let me be clear - the room and hotel be clean and well maintain . there be nothing wrong with the hotel , it ' s just a little dated . pool 3 star the pool area be small , but nice . the pool be clean and clear . it be probably the best part of the hotel . this be not a full service hotel , and they be in need of more front desk and general staff . housekeeping be fine . there be only a small restaurant where we do not eat . there be plenty of place to eat on international drive . many be within walk distance . the area be very nice down international drive towards sea world and the convention center . there be lot of shop and restaurant . the other way towards universal be a little sketchy with bad hotel . this location i very convient to sea world and universal , but about 8 to 10 mile to various disney location .",0,219
"great location . good value . a very short walk ( 400 yard ) from downtown disney and part of the free disney park shuttle service that run every half hour . good family friendly pool - a shallow sprinkler area be perfect for the little one . service during our two night stay be good , no complaint . the room be okay - both of ours show a little wear - expect for a high use hotel but a bit more than i ' d expect for this price point . but really , not too bad . free ( but not strong ) wifi . ( we be in the tower so can ' t vouch for the lower exterior rooms. ) one feature be the character breakfast . for $ 25 per adult head , goofy ( or pluto ) will stop by for pic and giggle while you eat your buffet breakfast . worth every penny if you have small child , but overprice if all you want be breakfast . parking be free , no need for valet unless you be lazy . overall a good hotel for location , price point and family . just don ' t expect the ritz and it ' s all good . 3 star .",0,218
"the family room be comfortably nice for up to 2 adult and 1 child , with 2 queen bed and one couch . fridge have no freezer option . microwave be useful . the decor of 1960s be deco be please . some shower have no door , just a curtain to keep in water . shuttle bus to city walk be super- convenient , leave every 10 minute and stop right next to the escalator up to city walk entrance . no shuttle to/ from airport mean you will be spend about $ 50 on a taxi each way . no express pas offer at this hotel . in 2016 , a new lowe ' s hotel will be open nearby , with a tropical theme , add to the option . the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff be inconsistent . for the most part they don ' t want to be bother . the guy who hold our bag act unfriendly until i tip him 2 $ . then he suddenly treat u like long lose family member . the pool area look so cool , but we be at the park all the time so we have to miss them . four day be just not enough for u to enjoy the area .",1,218
"sufficient for what we need . a clean place to sleep and where dog be welcome . the rate we pay be $ 70/ night in late july . there be no upcharge or nonrefundable fee for the dog which be nice . i do notice the minute we enter the room that it smell a bit damp/ mildewy . i think that be unavoidable when you have a window ac unit and not central ac . it wasn ' t overwhelming or anything like that . the room be large with a king bed , desk , area with mini fridge and microwave . the sink be separate from the toilet/ shower part of the bathroom . shower work fine save for the one rogue spout in the shower head that want to spray me in the eye . there be no complimentary breakfast which kind of sucked . i guess what can you expect from a bargain hotel . this be locate on the quieter end of i- drive , close enough to `` the action '' but not directly on the main drag . contrary to other review i think the wifi work fine . we would probably stay here again if we come with the dog and be look for budget friendly accommodation .",0,218
"nice hotel . room be clean , spacious and comfy . pool area be great and have a lazy river and waterslide . the basketball court and fitness center be also top notch amenity . there be a few restaurant on site and a small marketplace that have sandwich , drink , etc . the `` gastro pub '' have some good fish and chip , enchilada , corn chowder , and nacho . the little jalepeno cornbread be a nice touch . the beer selection be decent include some dogfish head brew and a local organic beer among others . price be a bit high especially for the food item in the `` marketplace '' . if you be stay here you probably expect the higher price or don ' t care . that ' s acceptable . what ' s not acceptable be the slow service at some of the restaurant . for example , it be nearly impossible to get the waiter ' attention at the poolisde bar to get our check and then to pick it up . this happen about 3 or 4 time during our stay . an appetizer order at the inside bar take about 45 minute . fix those problem and this place would be worthy of 5 star .",1,218

"surprise : the guestroom be fantastic ! so clean , roomy , and nicely appoint with beautiful decor ! there be 9 build with 1 - 4 around the standard hotel pool , 7 - 9 around the water park ( which be very noisy until 10pm a you should expect ) and a tower with interior entrance . the fitness center be lovely a well . the waterpark be a blast - my kid and i have a swell time and felt safe with lifeguard presence . we be worry about the weather but the kid pool be under a roof so no issue there . let down : the bar make horrible drink - horrible . stick with beer . the restaurant could do with an overhaul of the menu and decor . most staff be rude . the area for pizza hut / snack at lunch have the entire staff there wait for there order which make me a a customer feel very awkward . like in all the hotel i ' ve work at , staff should have a separate area for their meal or at the very least not be serve during busy hour . we will go back and stay the night again - the kid love it : )",1,216
"i pick this hotel because it be close to downtown disney . the room be huge ! it come with two queen bed and a couch . the room be nice and clean when we check in , room service be friendly and they deliver food to your room ( a very big deal when i stay at a hotel ) ! the food ? delicious ! ! i be obsess with their broccoli pasta dish all three night i be there ! downtown disney be about a mile and a half away walk . you can see the downtown disney sign from the hotel but don ' t be fool ! you still have a mile walk after that sign before you actually get to downtown ! if you decide to venture straight instead of cross the street to the sign ; there ' s a plaza with a grocery store , taco bell , micky d ' s , sweet tomato and a few other shop and restaurant . if you really don ' t mind walking , there ' s the premium outlet which be about a three mile walk from the hotel ( or a $ 7 cab ride depend on your driver ) . i would definitely stay here again !",1,216
find this hotel/ villas through a vacation club type of deal . heard good thing about it but it all change when we get there . the unit be a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom . . . . good size for 3 couple and 2 kid . good size kitchen with washer/ dryer inside the unit . no laundry detergent . you have to buy detergent if you need to wash your clothes . you have to pay if you don ' t take your garbage out everyday . the garbage can be a 5 minute walk from the room . crazy ! ! ! the bed get bedbug that will bite you nasty ! ! ! ! my whole family still get mark from the bite a month later ! ! ! it get bruise . no room service for 5 day ! ! ! no towel exchange ! terrible service . we complaint but nothing be do ! not come back at all to this place ! ! ! i will get my money and spend somewhere nicer and with room service everyday ! ! very disappointed at the hotel and the stuff . . . . . manager didn ' t seem to care about our complaint . absolut waste of money !,0,216
i recently have the pleasure of stay here with a business associate . the hotel be gorgeous . i be in love with the grand staircase in the lobby . i stay two night fro a conference be hold here and be impress with the hotel . the pool area be very nice and the restaurant int he hotel have wonderful food though a little high on price . that say there be other place in the area to eat so not a huge problem . my room be nice . i like the whole sit area be separate from the sleep area . we have two queen size bed that be very comfortable . there be two tv one in the bedroom and one in sit room so hat be nie . the bathroom be spacious and we have plenty of amenity in case we forget anything . the staff be friendly . room clean and well stock . plus food and atmosphere be really pleasant . also a i be there for a conference all staff that attend to out workshop and our luncheon be very nice and well trained . overall a nice stay . i would like to return with family for a weekend get away just to enjoy this hotel .,1,216
"i be amaze at the bad review . i have stay here twice in a many week and have my expectation exceed on both occasion . let me first say i be review this a a moderately price hotel not the ritz carlton . i be here on business and have not see one bug ! the room have be spotless on both occasion . i also have look at it a if i have child and want to take them on vacation without have to put a second mortgage on my house to do it ! my assessment be that it would be kid friendly . they have a nice pool , a child ' s theatre , a game room and a nintendo wee . the people here be nice and dennis in the bar make the best martini in the state ( well , at least in this area ) . the restaurant have another `` ray of sunshine '' name robbie . i honestly buy coffee just to see here smiley face . great place , no complaint . of course , if you want ritz carlton quality then it would be best to pay the price - but i warn you , they don ' t have dennis or robbie !",1,216
"we just get back from a whirl- wind three- day two- night visit to disney world and i be in need of a serious nap . it be amaze and fun , fantastic and exhaust . the detail that have be put into every aspect of the visuals , the sound , the whole experience be totally worth the time , the money and the sweat . i could have easily spend a whole extra week there . i would recommend stay on the ground , you get extra hour each day at various park for sleep on the property . there be also longer hour at each park on different day , but they give you a list of the hour when you check in . figure out the busing system first thing , they have it down to a science , but you have to know the system . once you park your car they really make it easy to not have to use your car again , and why would you want to , really ? ? for me , the best part , beyond the sight and the ride , be the people watch , the best i have see , outside of my home town of new orleans , anywhere .",1,216
"the location and the common area be great . you can walk to downtown disney which be a huge benefit during the heavy dinnertime/ nighttime traffic . they have spend the money on the common area and not the room . not an `` upscale '' room by any mean . everything metal be rusty , the fixture be mismatch , random lamp and furniture ( not eclectic , more garage sale ) the bathroom door be so warped , it would not close , etc . the water pressure be very strong . normally i love this but in this tiny bathroom , it be blow the shower curtain out of the tub and flood the bathroom floor . housekeep didn ' t come until 5 : 10 in the afternoon after we be already back from our day and want to rest a bit . on checkout , a manager take care of u . she be obviously not happy about have to be at the desk . not rude but short and not engage . the biggest thing i didn ' t care for be the lack of anyone smiling or even say hello . except for the valet staff , not one single employee of the hotel offer a random hello .",0,216
"overall , this be a good experience . we move here and expect to move in to our house rental , but it be not clean in time . hence we need a room for two night . i explain our situation , but be not give a discount . literally , the parking lot have six car overnight last night . i know since my dog want to go outside four time from 3 be until 600am . another reason this isn ' t five star be there be a surly breakfast lady who do not have all the food and beverage ready until 620am . if you offer 6am breakfast , a reasonable guest expect a hotel to deliver what be advertise . the business center have slow computer which likely use dial up . it take me 12 minute to open up yahoo email . the hot tub be barely above 90 degree . on a positive note , the room be clean , quiet , and the ac work great . the tv and cable reception be epic . football game be exquisite . the breakfast food be above average . the shower have great water pressure . the bathroom be large . the staff be congenial , gregarious and helpful .",1,216
"my husband and i have stay here 3 time now and we haven ' t be disappoint yet . now we be pretty low maintenance when it come to hotels see a we visit orlando for the theme park , not the hotel bed . this place have be under construction but that hasn ' t affect our stay whatsoever . free parking , close to the disney park with free transportation to the park . the counter staff be very nice & amp ; helpful . they help u combine two different reservation we make through priceline so that we could remain in the same room for our entire 4 night stay . the room be clean enough ( few strand of hair in the bathroom ) and the bed be comfy . the buffet wasn ' t very impressive but they do offer one item that make it worth the $ 9 ( decent price for an orlando breakfast ) mickey waffle station ! ! ! ! ! you make your own mickey waffle ! i be so incredibly happy about this lol and speaking of food , they have a bar in the lobby and be in walk distance to seadog brewery & amp ; kobe japanese restaurant . both awesome place !",1,216
"big disappointment : ( the hotel be very outdated and also , very dirty . from the carpet throughout the hotel have stain all over them to the sheet and towel in the room be cover in some questionable stain . the guest room be musty , you ' re able to open up the balcony door and there ' s way too much humidity that have go into the room and seep into the wall and the rug . they room have a horrible little smell to them . also , before our arrival , i call room control to request one room with a king and one room with queen , they mess up the request even after the person on the phone guarantee i would receive the room i request . lastly , and the most infuriating be that i leave the `` do not disturb sign on my room '' while i be away for the day and instead , i come back to find , it be remove and they go in the room anyway . a total privacy violation . i don ' t recommend this hotel at all ! they show on the travel sit a be a 4 star hotel , they need to reevaluate their designation .",0,216
"when go on a work- cation you don ' t usually expect to stay at such a fabulous hotel . after spend five night at the radisson hotel , i only have three gripe . one be the sleep number bed , while it be awesome and i be excite to use it , after the fifth night my back and neck be kill me because of the difference between the sleep number and my bed at home . my second gripe be that the food be overprice and under quality for be `` hotel '' food . i only ate here once but i do not enjoy the food , however the service be excellant . my third and final gripe , be that we be in a room that be right next to the service elevator . even though , i be only `` in '' on one morning while housekeeping be make the round , i still could hear it loudly if anyone use the elevator . if i travel back to orlando area again , i will try to stay with them but preferably in a different hotel room . all in all , they deserve four star maybe even five if my back didn ' t still bother me .",1,215
"i come here for a conference in june . i will compare it to a conference i go to in la vega recently . first of all , i find the decor very outdated , 80 ' sish ? . not at all modern or fancy . for the price you pay , you would expect something very updated and stylish . i be spoil at my conference in vega because a lot of the hotel there be completely deck out . everything be very expensive , for no good reason . although i suppose all of the hotel in the area be super overprice . they air- condition the shit out of every building . so much so that you will need to always carry a warm sweater with you wherever you go even though it ' s really hot outside . it would be nice if they would have it a little warmer so it ' s not such a shock go outside . not to mention the colossal waste of energy . staff be very friendly . i find it a little odd the lack of seat they have outside . overall , i would not come back . but disney world isn ' t really my cup of tea anyway .",0,215
"good : clean room , nice lobby , decent breakfastbad : 1 . * * traveller beaware * * - they will tell you about $ 5 . 09 per night at check- in . they should have added/ include that fee to their publish rate so that there be no or surprise - . i contact the hotel after return from the trip and demand a refund . however they feel no shame about hide hidden fee . . . shame on them . they want to appear competitive to shopper and hit you when you arrive . it be nothing but a `` robbery '' . 2. extremely slow internet - i have to use my phone 3g service instead . 3. they don ' t allow people to take the food beyond the kitchen . this suck because sometimes you want to take food to your room and eat . sometime you simply do not have time to eat in the hotel , so you want to take the food with you . the hotel say this be due to the recommendation of the osceola county health department . you know what i stay at the la quinta inn in orlando late march 2013 and they do not have this policy .",0,215
"i stay here on a recent trip to disney . i have to say this place be magnificent ; the very large indoor atrium with tree , plant and stream make this place very unique . it have two very nice pool , one of which be for adult only , and also two hot tub spas . they have a complementary shuttle service to disney ( include in the resort fee ) which make get to and from the park a breeze . the shuttle be always on- time and have plenty of room , it be basically a large motor coach . the room be also very clean but they will soon be do some upgrade to the bed and instal flat screen tv ' s. the downside be the parking , there be two choice valet or self- park . i ' m not sure what the valet cost daily but the self- parking option be $ 12/ day unlimited in/ out . the layout could have be more thought- out a well , when come from the parking lot , you have to change elevator to go to most room other than the one on the first floor . all in all though , it be a very nice hotel .",1,215
"this place be in a generally nice area , and have all of the basic store and restaurant nearby , however the hotel itself be not the most favorable . all of the building be far away from each other , the wall be extremely thin , and you only get housekeep if you stay there for more than 10 day . on top of that , in the room i be stay in , the shower curtain have dirt or something on the inside so obviously they didn ' t bother to clean it . on one of the night the room above me be make noise at about 12 am- roll luggage around , stomp , run , etc . . i have to be up at 5 that morning so i try call the front desk to complain , but every time i call they say they be busy help other customer . i call about 6 time and be on hold for 5 minute each time but still no one answer . i would have walk down to the front desk but it be 0 . 6 mile away from our building so that be out of the question . aweful customer service would definitely consider stay somewhere else .",0,214
"the front desk be unable to accommodate my request i have purchase the room through a third- party site which they charge me for and then the hotel be try to charge me a well ask to get my money back from the hotel after prove to them that it be pay for they tell me that they would have to check with management before do so . i have to do my own maintenance on the room the tv be not hook up to the cable box and cable box not plug into the wall also the sliding door would not lock and the security lock in the hallway of build 12 do not work allow anyone that want to come in to the hallway access from the wawa convenience store a stone throw away . have to fight for park spot because the wawa customer we ' re parking in the resort spot . the pool be a mess , the tile be all black and you could barely see the bottom of the pool because it be so murky . i pay the additional price to have breakfast include but also have to prove to the front desk that it have be pay for before i could receive my coupon .",0,214
"this be not an onsite hotel . regardless of what they tell you it ' s a mile long walk path to get to the theme park . yes , they do offer a free shuttle but to me walk a mile be not onsite by any stretch of the imagination . i ' ve stay at offsite hotel that take me le time to walk in to the park . the staff be friendly and the hotel be clean and nicely decorate . that ' s about all i have to say that ' s good for this place . the sheet and towel be poor quality and the bed be hard and uncomfortable . the room be clean and cute in appearance but i felt it lack attention to detail that adult would appreciate . there be no room service at all , and if you order from one of their preferred outside delivery restaurant you have to go down to the lobby to retrieve your food ( which can be quite a hike depend on where your room be locate ) . i ' m sure this place be ok for family and kid but for 2 grown people on a well deserve vacation i be not impress at all .",0,214
"my husband buy a deal from live social for thurston house for a weekend getaway . the original weekend we plan have to be postpone due to a medical emergency . the next weekend we plan be also something we couldnt do , so we end up pay full price of 250 . 00 a night . she be unwilling to work with u , say the original deal have february black out and the inn be almost sell out . out . upon arrivng on friday she mention that we would have the place to ourselves that night but it be full for saturday . turn out we be the only guest . that be a little disappointing a we like to meet new people wherever we go . the house be beautiful and well keep . we be not big fan of the food a we like a breakfast that be not so fussy . we tell that to carol on saturday night but sunday be another overly sweet and rich breakfast . although carol go out of her way with birthday cupcake in the room and a candle in my muffin at breakfast , i would have be more at home at the ritz carlton for that amount of money .",1,214
"go here to stay last minute before go to disney world and universal studio . my family and i stay for 2 day . the room be nicely decorate a compare to the ugly , dirty outside of the hotel and lobby ; however , it smell for some reason inside the room after be clean . and not a good smell . the man work at the guest service desk be very friendly and the front desk be very patient when try to get u into a room last minute with early check- in . what would have be 3 star go down to 1 because they day of check- out , not even leave the hotel yet ( still in the lobby ) , i realize i forget my watch in the hotel room and when i go up to get it , it be go . i notice the trash have be take out from the room . so basically it be steal a i have not find my watch in my luggage or anywhere since then . sad . . . i just buy that watch a couple day before from the cruise that i go on . $ 60 go . never come back . be warn .",0,213
"very weak . our group of 20 stayed here for a conference nearby . 3 night . never again . not even at half the $ 109 we pay . more than a few of u walk with luggage to distant room to find the key card didn ' t work . all the room share a moderately strong musty , moldy smell and cigarette smoke leftover . i ask for a room change because of this . the second room be a bad a the first . the clerk spray some fabreeze on the curtain to help me out ( nice touch , eh ? ) the bed have really cheap , thin linen and the mattress be uncomfortable . because it ' s `` extend stay '' the housekeeping be set to happen only every few day . mine say `` on wednesday '' but they be a no- show for my room . the breakfast be a minimal a i ' ve ever see in a budget hotel . the yogurt be long overdue to be trash . several of u open them to find funky science at work . this be a huge fail . guarantee to exclude extended stay america a one of our corporate choice anywhere .",0,213
"during my stay in may i find the room to be quiet , which be nice . the breakfast buffet be sufficient if not extravagant , but not overprice , either . the outdoor tiki bar be a plus , and they have some nice wine and even a wine cooler , which be a smart thing for red wine outdoors in florida . i try do the green thing after see the brochure in the room and hung my towel that i would re- use , but the cleaning staff take them away anyway . the outdoor pool be nice , and the hotel have fresh bake cooky available most day . currently there be not much nearby a far a dining , but if you be around for a short time or mostly go to the tourist site , you will be fine . you can easily eat meal on site if need be , but keep in mind it do feel a bit like a breakfast room if you plan to dine indoors during the evening . if the weather be good , dine at the tiki bar ! between the premium outlet and the millennium mall , you can keep busy with shop if you be so inclined .",1,213
"the address list here be wrong . this hotel be on 6500 international drive . the lobby be the best part of the hotel . the room be dreary , with poor ventilation . this make them smell a little musty , but on the plus side , the moisture be probably because the wonderfully hot water flood the room with humidity whenever you shower . be wary of the the `` free '' wifi . if you be stay on one of the higher floor you may get what you be pay for , and by that i mean no internet connectivity whatsoever . there be no room service available , and delivery company be not allow to come to your room . you must come down to the lobby to retrieve your order . i have stay in two different room here with the same result ( long story ) , trust me the repeat wasn ' t my choice . if all you need be a hot shower and a clean bed ( and your sense of smell isn ' t very strong ) this may be the hotel for you . all in all , a lousy experience , and one i suggest you avoid altogether if possible .",0,213

i ' ll keep this review short because you should already know the deal when it come to walt disney world . walt disney world deserve five star because it be a good a it get when it come to theme park . yes you could say it ' s relatively expensive but it ' s not that pricey . it really be `` the most magical place on earth '' when you ' re a kid and come back a an adult you really get to appreciate all the effort and detail that go into the disney experience . wdw doesn ' t focus on thrilling and nauseate ride . the ride focus on fun and that they be . space mountain be still one of my favorite roller coaster . the hall of president have pretty nifty audio- animatronics president include barack obama . it can be a bit creepily lifelike but i suggest check it out . usually firework be just firework for me but i forget how awesome they can be . we catch the last night of the summertastic celebration and the firework really wow me . get close to the castle if you can because that ' s where the audio be play .,1,210

i recently stay here for a seminar and even though the hotel be very clean and beautiful . i most likely would not stay there again . for the amount of money you pay per night you can find another beautiful and clean hotel in orlando at least offer free wifi and continental breakfast . we also have to get up to go order our drink at the bar which really stink when you be sit at the other end of their huge pool . plus once over there it take 30 min to order our 2 drink . with all the amazing hotel in orlando i think they need to get with the program . for the amount of money you spend per night i would expect something extra besides a comfortable bed . almost every hotel in orlando have nice room and a lazy river . the hotel staff be very friendly but for $ 200 a night unfortunately it ' s not enough . also they tax you per night and per person so we have an extra $ 50 add on our bill at the end .,0,191
the price be right . the room be okay other than our scary view . the hot tub be break from the moment we get there . the water be cold . we put in multiple request . they say multiple time the engineer be come to look into the hot tub situation but it never happen . by the time we check out it be still cold . so much for a relaxing vacay relaxing in a hot tub . nothing excite about their alligator attraction . if you want to see alligator go across the street to see the indiana jones type show at gator golf with 50+ large gator . when we do our initial check in they could not find our reservation even though we give them the name it be under . around 1 o ' clock the next day when we return to our room to pack up we have already be lock out of our room and it take 30 minute for them to let u get back in . there appear to be a great deal of lack of communication between staff .,0,191

( bed be comfy ) there be also a huge mirror that run against the wall where the headboard on the bed should go it ' s actually a little weird ! let ' s just say the area that be hotel be locate i thought would be nicer or more updated ! the only really plus be that their be a mini fridge and microwave in the room ! other then that this hotel stink and would not recommend it for family ' s maybe a single person stay for a night ! oh and they charge u some kind of resort fee of 5 . 31 a night to stay in there hotel and use there special feature which idk what they be ! ! !",0,191

"i don ' t have anything bad to say about my stay here , i would recommend it and definitely stay here again ! it be 5 minute from universal and about 20 from disney . they also have free shuttle . i have stay at another hotel for a similar price my first night and be absolutely disgusted pls see review of orlando continental plaza hotel . but the rest of my three day trip we have a room reserve here at the wingate by wyndym which come to $ 149 for 3 night with tax so it be not only cheaper than the other hotel but no deposit ! free breakfast with waffle ! ! and it be comfortable and clean ! there ' s a pool and a jacuzzi down stair . we also check out 30minutes late and while i be nervous head down to check out she just smile and say you ' re all set ! they be so nice . peter at the front desk be very nice and helpful ! which just go to show affordable do not mean gross !",1,189
"i stay in this hotel for a conference . about the only thing to recommend it be the convenience to the convention center . otherwise it ' s a little outdated , and while the room be clean i definitely saw a roach scuttle around the bathroom at one point . furthermore the curtain on the window don ' t close all the way , not that they ' re broken they ' re literally design not to close all the way , which mean i have the bright light from the front drive shining in my room all night make it near impossible to sleep . the toilet also didn ' t quite flush properly and the shower curtain weirdly curve around the bathtub so water get all over the floor . the bathroom light definitely need to be replace , mine sputter like something out of the shin before they would turn on . again it ' s nice and close to the convention center and the pool be nice , but this hotel should stop solely rely on it location and step up it game .",0,189
"if i could give this hotel a zero star i would . this be one nasty place and i can ' t understand why it be still open for business . i be visit a friend there last night and saw how nasty and mean they be to this family of 4. the front desk girl name erica if i be your bos you be look for a job today . how could you take this family ' s money and then not give them the room promise to them . what be society come too . how do you know this family now need the money you be hold to continue their vacation . not everyone be bear with a silver spoon in their mouth . people work very hard to save their money for vacation . i tell my friend to get out of there asap . you have probably ruin this family ' s vacation . personally after how i saw this family treat , i can honestly say , i will never , ever stay there . i hope you can sleep at night .",0,189
"i be willing to bet that this place be a real beauty in it day . unfortunately , that be not the case anymore . i go down with a group , and our stay be book for u . when the person whom i be room with check in , they keep ask if we have a pet . when she say no , they ask if she be sure . they seem to not believe her . i mean come on . we be still give a `` pet '' room . it smell like wet dog , but that be probably because there be a huge wet spot next to the door . we couldn ' t locate a working ice machine . the clencher , though ? no free coffee , except for the crappy tiny in- room coffee maker that make swim pool flavor brown hot liquid . $ 135 a night , and no free coffee in the lobby . thumb down ! to be fair , the shower be surprisingly effective , and the guy work the bar be super nice .",0,189
"i have stay in this resort every year for the past 4 year . this year be so disappointing ! the condo be small and cramp a compare to our usual large open floor plan condo . the kitchen be tiny , the overhead light in the bedroom be so dull it be completely useless . i like lot of light so i can see so this be unacceptable . when we arrive , the lock box on the door do not work due to battery failure and it take 15 minute for them to get to it to fix it . we be in the building right next to the office so i have no idea what take so long . the wireless internet go down every 20 minute . the staff be nice although they offer no help for the small , cramped condo issue . every year when we stay here we have internet problem and that be get tire . i will be look around for another resort to stay in next year a i be feed up with the issue in this resort .",0,189

"i be write this review a a customer who be not here on an expense account . the resort be huge and impossible to walk anywhere . the minimum taxi charge be go to run over $ 20 and that only get you to downtown disney so you be basically hold prisoner by the resort . the hamburger be not a large a other review would have you believe and be $ 16. yes the pool be nice , but it be not a nice or a large a other review would have you believe . but , there be lot of chair to sit on at the pool ! the downside be that there be not many electrical outlet at the pool even though wifi do extend to the pool area . add to that the various complaint from other reviewer such a the parking fee , in room wifi fee , slow wifi service , mini bar cost , resort fee and ridiculous charge for food and drink and i will have to say that i have have far better hotel experience in my life .",0,188
"stay here in february 2013 for a field hockey showcase . rate be really good and the room be very clean and very large . we be pleased to see the small fridge and microwave in the room also . very nice pool area which include 2 hot tub , but the pool/ bar do close early ( 11 : 00 ) which be disappoint . an applebees be attach to the hotel . service there be very slow . i read in another post about someone have a bad experience where their car be break into . we do see a security guard walk the parking lot at night so they must have improve security after that event . you need a hotel room key to enter most area , however we find a door that you can enter the hotel from the outside with no room key . then we understand why each day local place be put menu ' s under our door . i feel that be a security issue . overall i would definitely stay here again , we be very pleased .",1,188

"stay here for 4 night . great location , nice park for walk or run around the lake . near many restaurant and shop area . hotel be beautiful . i have stay in many embassy suite and most be super . this one disappoint in their attention to detail . our room have a musty smell . the shower have no pressure and no hot water . maintenance replace shower head and valve which correct the pressure problem . we be tell to let the water run for at least 5 min before shower for hot water ( what a waste of water ) . sink at in room counter spray water over the counter . the glass in the `` glass '' elevator be dirty . printer do not work in business center . on a good note , the breakfast be very good and so be the snack and drink at the manager ' s reception . a good push on maintenance and housekeeping would make this an awesome hotel . right now it ' s `` ok ''",0,182
"i have stay at this hotel many time over the year for both business and personal travel purpose . it sadden me greatly to witness firsthand how poor that the service have now become at this hotel . throughout my recent two night stay i experience problem range from three valet not be able to locate my car or my key because they could not remember where it be park , to call the front desk three consecutive time to request that housekeep bring up additional coffee packet , which might i add never show up . . . . 40 minute to prepare 5 ahi nacho at the sand bar that be smaller than an average dorito chip to housekeep not show up until almost 4pm daily to clean the room . . . . . there be far better option in the orlando marketplace to spend your hard earn dollar . take my advice a someone that be a lifetime platinum member with marriott ( 1100 night stay ) this hotel be not worth stay at . . . .",0,182
"this be by far the worst hotel experience i have ever have . i be only give them a star because i have to , otherwise i would give them nothing . they be rude and not accommodate at all . the room be gross and old . the bed be hard and the whole room smell like mildew . manager provide incorrect information about shuttle location in disney , a well a misinform u of the arrival and departure time . due to this , we have to find a cab to take u back to the hotel . when we confront them about this , they promise over the phone that they would reimburse u for our cab fee . however , once we get there , the manager refuse to reimburse u . do not give them business and do not stay at this hotel . i recommend stay in disney . the extra $ 30 a night for a disney hotel be well worth the money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !",0,181
"my parent stay here while in town for a conference . i didn ' t get the chance to fully explore the hotel , but i hang out in there room a bit and let ' s just say it ' s f- a- n- c- y. my two favorite feature be the television in the bathroom mirror and there be this little light that come on under the bedside table when it detect that you ' d step down out of bed . additionally , the bedding be super comfy and it look like the pool area be really nice . the peabody be locate right near a bunch of restaurant and such so it be easy to meet up with my parent and walk down to find dinner . and don ' t even get me start on the duck . my mom say they have duck shape butter at their meal and she send me home with duck shape soap which be so hilarious ; i ' ve name them and have them sit on my bookshelf .",1,181
"old men grunt a lot when they poop . i learn this unfortunate fact when i , too , have to use the restroom . it ' s kind of community style . not much privacy - you can chat over the stall while wipe . or under them , for that matter . no fan . no music . no privacy . no miss everything that ' s go on in the next stall . i think he have taco for dinner last night . the course here be great ; come to play golf . don ' t come for the price , the remoteness , the toll upon toll to get here , the golf- factory atmosphere , or the drunken tool they pair you with . or , god forbid , the restroom . again , the course be fantastic , but $ 120 per round should not have to have a six- dollar bucket of 25 range ball tack on top of it . $ 120 should include free range ball . stop be dick .",1,181
"this place be amaze ! i will never take a multi day trip to wdw unless we stay here . they offer many special throughout the year . we stay during their red white and blue salute package ( minimum four night stay and breakfast/ dinner include for two adult and two child ) . child under 6 always eat free . they have two restaurant , one buffet style and the other appear to be more formal sit down and order style . free breakfast/ dinner be in the buffet restaurant with different themed dinner each night . breakfast offer an omelette grill , fresh fruit , yogurt , egg , potato , sausage , muffin , pastry , waffle . shuttle to and from wdw that allow you to stay late for show . only open to dod , military , and retiree . this prevent weird foreigner from stay here . small px with various food , beverage , and disney merchandise . itt on site . very family friendly ! i be actually sad to leave .",1,181

( da plane da plane - to quote fantasy island ) they tell me it be sound proofed and insulated and i wouldn ' t hear plane ! i hear plane so loud that wake me i think it be wwiii and this be way worse than pearl harbor and it be all over for me . i be on the top floor grant but there be no insulation ! i have stay in the airport before and never hear a peep ( that hotel - not starwood property ) be insulate ) but this ! ? i hear them roar over a i write this . awful . and couldn ' t sleep because of it ! especially in the morning !",0,181
"just a another fellow yelper mention , we book the night before and find a good deal on hotwire for it . to be honest , i be nervous about stay here after see all of these terrible review but when we arrive , it wasn ' t too bad . it wasn ' t the closest hotel to the park but it be fairly easy to get to . it ' s true that i wouldn ' t call it a resort , but the room we have seem clean and we have a mini fridge and a microwave . nice for just a place to sleep for a night . i wouldn ' t stay for more than 2 night though . the staff weren ' t the friendliest in the world but they be ok. they give out nice packet of coupon and information , but we didn ' t really need them . final verdict : not the best but not the worst . for a quick , economical place to stay , i recommend champion .",0,181
"don ' t be fool , if you be use to the `` disney experience '' you will be sorely mistake to think you will get it here . swan dolphin be run by a large chain hotel company not disney . the service be terrible , staff member be not to the same calibre of disney cast member . nothing be cheaper here than stay at a disney resort , therefor not worth it . they even charge you to park your car , $ 16 per day ! disney resort be free park include at all the park ! the room be really out date and show the age of the hotel . do yourself the favor and book a true disney resort , they don ' t disappoint . don ' t be fool by the imposter . enjoy all what disney be to offer . a you can tell i have stay and a few disney resort and now swan dolphin . i will never make the mistake again . disney resort be the real deal .",0,181
"ahhhhh . . . my first experience stay at the ritz . i come here for a dental conference and i have to say , the room be impeccable . the bed be very comfy , separate bath and shower and dual sink . the room be very spacious and the room service be awesome . of course stay at the ritz do expect to pay a lot especially room service . there be a $ 4 delivery charge , 22 % gratitudity , and florida state tax already add to your bill . they have two great restaurant inside norman and vineyard grill . both be excellent but again a bit pricy . the hotel be somewhat seclude so you will need to travel a couple mile out to grab dinner or shopping . they have a full golf course with a restaurant for a leisurely afternoon . overall , i have a great experience stay here but i would rent a car if you really want to explore orlando a cab fare can add up very quickly .",1,180
"4 star if visit sea world , 3 star if you aren ' t . . . i didn ' t. i like the room though , have a nice feel to it . they kill you with the addons though . $ 10 for self parking ? and it be a hassle everytime i go through a my room card never work . no free breakfast , no internet . . . thank goodness for the free cookie lol . . . they be good . bed be soft . i wouldn ' t hesitate to stay here if go to seaworld but i probably would look elsewhere if i ' m not ( unless priceline sends me here for cheap ) i didn ' t mind the extra so much because of the $ 43 rate i get on priceline . don ' t know if the resort area be extra or not , didn ' t have time to check it out , but it look nice with a mini golf course , and other activity .",0,180
"hotel be walk distance from downtown disney that ' s the only positive about my experience at this hotel . on arrival front desk staff have no idea what type of room we reserve we offer to show our reservation they decline to look at it and needle to say we be not place in the room we have book we have to make several trip to the front desk before one of the staff finally review our reservation and change our room . everyone ' s answer basically be they couldn ' t change it . the ac in the room say 68 however it felt like 88. the window have no black out curtain so after an exhausting day and night we we ' re awoken at 7 : 30am to bright sunlight streaming in the room . the location be a positive and a negative ; the traffic that to get in/ out of the hotel be horrendous , plan at least an extra 30 minute of wait time during he day and an hour at night",0,180
"wonderful hotel and great scene . would recommend to go to , but the ticket service desk have no clue what they be do . they all have the same excuse `` i work at a different hotel '' . shuttle time be wrong and the transportation company they use main gate , be horrendous . i be leave at a park and tell they have no clue who i be , even tho i have a reservation and voucher in my hand that say other wise . then tell me it be first come first serve so i would have to wait another 2 hour for the next ride . i explain to them i have a child le then a year sit here in the sun , they advisedme to purchase a taxi . of course when i get back , the hotel and trans company point finger at each other . all in all be a good place , just do your own research and get your own trans because the hotel will get you lose .",1,180
"scummy hotel . i make a reservation for 2 night . when i check in there be a couple complaing about a smelly room . smelly room ? probably they just get a bad room ( this hotel allow dog & amp ; cat ) . i check in and the receptionist where mad at life . i get to my room and omg it remind me of my cat ' pee . i man ' d up for the night , and i figure that all the room probably smell so why move room . the next day i ask to change room . guess what ? another nasty room and this one have a stain bed , a mold grow all over the bathroom , and some other bad smell . i try to get my money back and go to another hotel but they say no . i just leave on an early check out and go on my way . there be many hotel in orlando . for your own well be try another hotel .",0,180
"this hotel be great ! room be really nice and the shuttle to/ from the park be timely . the hotel lobby be spotless and the staff be very professional . i only have two small complaint : ( 1 ) there be no where in the hotel with good , cheap food . the hotel have a couple of restaurant that be either upscale ( $ $ $ ) or have an unappealing selection of food . ( 2 ) the hotel bar locate by the pool close early ! we saw an advertisement that the bar have the nfl sunday ticket package , so we go out there around 6 : 00 pm to watch some of the game and have a drink . when we get there , they be already close up ! the bar manager be there and offer to leave the tv on so we could at least watch the game while they be clean up , which be really nice of them . all in all , it be a great experience .",1,180
"this hotel be on par with other homewood suite i have stay in . what give this an extra star be the free beer and wine happy hour , free hot breakfast , and free dinner . yes , free dinner . it ' s not extravagant , but it be free . while i be there , we get chicken tortellini with cream sauce and stuff green pepper . consider my first dinner in town be $ 35 ( incl drink ) , i can quantify that homewood suit save me approximately $ 70 on per diem . that ' s almost enough to pay for entry to epcot , and that ' s worth the extra star ! one thing to note- the hotel sit short end face alafaya trail , and a a result , the room stretch far back from the front of the highway and can be quite far from the front lobby/ eat area . if you have walk issue or be handicap , i recommend specifically request a room near the lobby .",1,180
"book have be write about walt disney world , so it seem fruitless to try to describe it in a simple post . i first visit in the mid 1980 ' s , and visit frequently during the expansion period of the 1990 ' s. it be still the number one family vacation destination in the world . period . there be some validity to `` disney magic. `` they have a way to make sure visitor be happy , and satisfy , and spend lot of money . their attention to detail be impeccable , from the attraction to the dining to the accommodation . there be thing to satisfy all age group , all year round . it be truly an international destination , and you will likely hear a multitude of language during your visit . some of the attraction be date , but there be a slow , relentless change and upgrading of attraction . definitely worth a trip , if you be one of the few who have not be there a yet .",1,179
"a nice hotel . some of the thing which we have become accustomed to be provide free of charge be not free here , such a breakfast and newspaper , but the room , convention area , and restaurant be top notch . quite a lovely place . excellent fitness center , but the hotel be so huge just go to your room be a pretty good workout . nifty little feature in the room such a automatic night light and a tv build into the bathroom mirror . a little stingy with the freebie , a `` luxury '' hotel often be . good security and low noise level . about $ 225 or so a night for a basic room , but right across the street from the orlando convention center so that ' s a saving in time and transportation if you ' re here for a convention . desk people , restaurant people and housekeeper be all quite friendly and lay back . a good experience overall for my once- per- decade hyatt stay .",1,179
"you should stay at the holiday inn hotel & amp ; suite across from universal orlando , at least if you ' re go to the park . a the name implies , the hotel be literally across from universal orlando , about a 15- minute walk- - or a $ 7 uber ride- - from the park entrance in nice weather . and although my friend book the reservation , i think we pay about $ 150/ night , a good deal for the location . unfortunately the holiday inn hotel & amp ; suite across from universal orlando seem to know that visitor be in the bag . they can get away with cut corner , like towel that be never replenish . or thermostat that don ' t quite cool the room . or tv with an unbelievably blurry picture . or receptionist who don ' t answer call from guest ' room . or wifi that ' s too slow to even connect . ( ugh. ) at least you can walk to universal .",0,179

"while i really enjoy the hotel the spa be disappoint at best . i pay $ 150 for a mani/ pedi and then they charge and extra $ 10 to scrub callas ( spell ? ) which be not bad . i certainly would have expect for the $ 90 pedi which wasn ' t the basic , not to be charge extra for something you normally get include in a pedicure . what be more disappointing be that when i ask at the front desk to check on why this wasn ' t cover they say they would definitely check and call be back or contact me . . . . . . well it have be several week and no followup . while it isn ' t a big amount , it be the point of this . definitely would not recommend the spa . it be high price , you have to pay `` extra '' and no followup . sadly this cast a negative shadow on my stay at an otherwise great hotel : (",0,179
"good : location to nearby theme park and other activitiesbad : everything elseoverall , the price be not outrageous but i expect much more out of the hotel . the room be surprisingly small for the amount the hotel charge . additionally , the normal reservation amount plus the ( non- optional ) `` resort fee '' doesn ' t even get you breakfast . we eat breakfast here just one morning ( for $ 12 per person ) and be offer buffet- style scramble egg , cereal and eggo waffle . it ' s an additional $ 2 if you ' d like coffee , $ 3 more if you want a muffin . after stay here for 7 day , i still haven ' t figure out what make this a `` resort '' and not a hotel . even the pool , hot tub and fitness center be only open until 11pm . you can pay additional $ $ for `` full maid service '' if you want more than just new towel every day .",0,179

"the portofino be a beautiful property . the room be very clean and the staff be attentive . my only gripe be that everything be so expensive . 18- 22 % gratuity be automatically add on to service at the pool bar and room service , and then that be tax . $ 91 for some salsa and chip , 2 order of chicken finger , and some toast ravioli . definitely not a meal worth $ 91 . $ 13 . 50 for a pina colada that have very little rum . the cheapest restaurant on site be sal ' s. but the quality of food vary there depend on the cook . it be cheaper to go to city walk and eat at margaritaville or one of the other great restaurant there , and the quality of food be better . besides the food , the stay be pleasant . hotel be quiet for the most part , and we stay over 4th of july . the room be clean and the bed be very comfortable .",1,179

"fortunately my stay be for a business trip and just for one night so i wasn ' t too picky . room be fair and cozy , the bed look dirty ( some stain , shabby comforter , nothing a call downstairs didn ' t fix ) . rate be ok but you can do better in the area . my biggest complaint be with the staff in general and especially the front desk staff . everyone have be cordial and accommodate but not one person have be especially friendly or even hospitable . upon check in , check out and the previously mention call to change the bed linens , i be treat like any other person in a long line of pay customer or just another task to check off of a list . never once do i feel like a priority or that the staff be on hand to see that i have the best stay possible . a little effort here would go a long way to make this hotel a better place .",0,178

"great centrally locate hotel right at the edge of the disney property . this hotel be often use for business convention so expect a lot of foot traffic . there be a handful of good dining option on- site so you don ' t even have to leave your hotel to eat . a couple of downside be the smoke detector ( that continuously beep on two separate night and have to get someone to come up and change the battery ) and the shower ( which didn ' t have enough pressure and wasn ' t hot enough and have a half glass door so the water spray everywhere on the floor ) . the staff be very friendly and make the whole experience so enjoyable- - i have interaction with the front desk staff , valet , room service , the technician who come up to fix my smoke detector , and the event planning staff . the free wi- fi be much appreciate !",1,167

"we love this place . we stay here every time we come to disney ( which be about once a month ) . the price be great ! we love the suite aspect , our daughter can go to bed and we hang out in the living room . the decor isn ' t very modern but we be barely in the room so it doesn ' t bother u . great happy hour deal at the pool side bar . the have complimentary breakfast but we have never tire it . coffee in the lobby be ok. short ride to disney ! ton of restaurant be the hotel . a 7- 11 right out front which be great ! we can ' t wait till our next trip and we will be stay here ! we find it by chance and couldn ' t be more happier it be everything we need for our disney trip",1,157
"we be all set to spend some serious time at disney a we `` win '' some ticket in our school ' s auction . disney be post record number and even close due to overcrowd . so we do the best thing we have do in a long time . we sit by the pool . we buy a big blow up dragon and two inner tube and float on the lazy river . we eat lunch poolside and didn ' t research the best haunt to go to . we watch tv in our room . we do not do this ever . it be such a great time for u . super clean , very modern and beautiful and the staff be well train in friendliness , but not obnoxiousness . brunch line look overwhelming but move very quickly and the food be great . . . love the singing waiter ! !",1,156
"my wife and i stay here while visit universal studio . we have to call the desk to find it . it sit back behind two restaurant and there be no sign on international drive . the hotel be only a ten minute ride to the studio . it be also very convenient to the many restaurant along international drive . many be within walk distance . the room be clean and comfortable , on the 6th floor . there be a bit of traffic noise from the highway so i would recommend get a room towards the international drive side of the hotel . the breakfast be very good with several choice . the staff be very friendly , greet you a you enter or leave . my only issue it the pet fee . they be pet friendly but at $ 25 . 00 per night , that ' s a bit steep .",1,156
"my husband and i ate here for the first time because we receive free meal voucher . even though we only pay 7 dollar out of pocket for two meal , an appetizer , and two drink , it still wasn ' t a good a we expect . our waitress didn ' t even understand what the voucher cover and almost charge u extra on our bill . she would also stand by our table and just watch u eat for about a minute and then walk away . this happen about four time throughout our din experience . the shrimp scampi have no flavor and my husband well do ribeye steak end up be serve to u super bloody and cold . definitely not worth the price , unless you have free meal voucher . hopefully this restaurant be just have a bad day and that ' s why the food be gross .",0,156
"let me explain my hampton rating . . . i ' m a fan of hampton . unless i be look for a resort , it ' s my go- to place where i know i be go to get a clean room , a yummy bed , and a decent breakfast . i rate most hampton 4 star . most be similar . occasionally one stand above the rest ; it get 5 star . the few that be not up to par with the rest get 3 star . this property be pretty much your average hampton . a for staff , they be excellent ! friendly and efficient . parking be no problem . breakfast be complete , and replenish efficiently a need . leave international drive behind by go west only a mile or so , drop the rate by a few dollar a night vs. other hampton in the area .",1,156
"at $ 37 . 00 for a full day ticket this place be a value . mr. toad ' s wild ride be worth the price of admission itself . i find the scene in pirate of the caribbean with pirate chase the lady to be a little rapey , but well : pirate . 20 , 000 league under the sea use to scare the crap out of me , but here be a pro tip : the submarine don ' t even go all the way under water . it be an illusion ! not to digress , but i recently learn that the jules verne novel ' s title refer to length of journey , not depth , which totally make sense . best place to trip on acid : sky ride . best place to slip and fall : the exit to big thunder mountain . this be my review .",1,155
"we stay in this hotel the night before depart for a cruise from port canaveral . this be a very nice hotel . it have nice , clean room , and be connect to the mall next door . there be a starbucks in the lobby that be pretty par for the course a far a starbucks go . the market in the lobby sell alcohol , snack and personal item . the woman work the counter name eurina be absolutely delightful . the cafe in the lobby charge $ 16 . 00 a person for breakfast , which i thought be ridiculous . grant , it be a good breakfast , but not for $ 16 . 00. the pool be huge and have nice quality towel . there be a nice business center with brand new apple computer and a very nice fitness room a well . i would recommend this hotel .",1,155
"i be at rosen shingle creek for a conference in september and have a great time . the hotel be great and the staff be friendly and helpful . i be able to enjoy the pool and the spa one day . the massage be out of this world , it be a deep tissue massage so it wasn ' t exactly relax when i be get it ( actually uncomfortable at time ) but i walk out of there feel like jelly . the pool be also great and the waitress go out of there way to be helpful . the only complaint i have be that it rain for 4 out of the 5 day i be there so i didn ' t get to enjoy the pool a much a i would have like . i guess i will have to come back to get more fun in the sun in .",1,155
"great location ! perfect for group . very spacious lobby with computer , tv , couch , and breakfast area . the computer be very slow so i recommend carry your own . the continental breakfast be large and have many option like cereal , fruit , different juice , waffle , egg , sausage , bread and pastry . however , the quality of the hot food be not the best . the room be equip with a quiet yet powerful ac unit . the sink however be not in the bathroom , they be out in the open . there be also a mini kitchenette with a microwave and refrigerator . the staff be very friendly with hospitable mannerism . they try to service every request to the best of the ability . in the end , very great hotel that need a little technology update and more comfortable pull out couch .",1,155
"i think myself lucky to have be able to travel to gaylord palm on a couple occasion for work . the ambiance be beautiful and seem to offer the whole experience . however , customer service be not a priority here . i dealt with the concierge on 3 occasion and each be very unpleasant . no welcome smile , no how can i help you attitude . i will say that valet be very kind . food and drink be ridiculously overprice , a you would find in the orlando area , but what gaylord ' s be offer be similar to a salad in a bag - wilt lettuce , douse in dressing , and have be sit out for a week . 2 star for the atrium , pool , accommodation , and polite valet . i advice stop at whole food to stock up on your own meal and water .",0,155
"all of the positive review have to be from employee or folk that have never stay at a five star resort . the condo be dark and gloomy . the kid room do not have a tv . the tv in the master bedroom be an old tube tv and probably from the 90 ' s. the couch and chair suck with a capital s. check in be a two step process . the girl behind the counter could not answer any question . the second counter , you must go to in order to receive your park pas . at this location they try to sell you everything from restaurant meal , disney , tour , etc . . . normally i would not mind but on this trip my son be sick from fly . we just want to get to our room so he can rest . anyway , not impressed .",0,155
"great location to all the good stuff , can be book for $ 100 a night , nice big room , pool and spa , kid eat free so what else could you want ? well the room have nice amenity like a flat tv , fridge , and microwave , so with a grocery store 1/ 4m away you can skip their breakfast buffet and save some good $ . it have nice update bathroom , but unfortunately due to consumption law the water flow for the sink be about 3x what come out of the shower- be prepare for a 20 minute shower to just get clean ! the balcony be nice and have chair and table so you can watch your kid from above the pool . there be a resident red tail hawk that have nest somewhere on the premise , watch for him sit on a balcony at night !",1,155
"i go a couple of day ago and i have be here 8 time before . this be a place that you need to go at least one time in your life . come prepared because there will be ton of fee and everything be expensive , but well worth it . if you have kid , the fun part be purchase an autograph book , so you can get autograph from all of the disney star . i never complete my book a a child ( wipe tear ) but you have to purchase the mickey mouse hat iif you want to walk around the theme park look cool ! plan this trip far ahead and get a hotel with a couple of room and a full kitchen . you might want to purchase the 5- day ticket pas in order to finish all of the park . it be definitely an adventure !",1,155
"we get this hotel when we try our luck on hotwire . it wasn ' t a good a some other choice in that star category , the hotel be a bit old on the outside , the elevator a bit cranky , but inside it be actually pretty clean and spacious . the bed be comfortable too and we didn ' t have problem sleeping . bathroom be on the small side , a others have comment . there be a fridge which be great . the guy who check u in be friendly . the hotel be very conveniently locate , right off the highway , which save significant time a it mean a lot le traffic to sit through . there ' s a whole food just a block or two away , great for buy drink and snack we need during the trip . plenty of restaurant choice around too .",0,155
"close , clean and economical . you get what you pay for . the staff be friendly but you can tell that the property be a little run down . for example , the bathroom door be in need of a finish . but for the price , it ' s comfortable and the continental breakfast be perfect - a little bit of everything for everyone - oatmeal , cereal , yogurt or waffle . nearby be also restaurant - hooter , chick- fil- a , a thai restaurant , kobe or walgreens . this be extremely helpful after spend a day at universal when your dog be bark and you just want to eat and sleep . my only warning be that when you reserve your hotel , make sure you check the address . there be a handful in the nearby area . we go to the one on kirkman first .",0,154
"if i be write solely on beauty and comfort this would be 5 star . the execution at the bohemian simply fall short . there be so many oversight that a an experienced business traveler i take for grant . # 1 put breakfast dangler on the door for breakfast ( simply a smoothie with coffee ) for 7 : 45 arrival- arrive at 8 : 25 . # 2 call for valet - no one answer finally call operator to have car bring around 15 min later still no car ( i be the only one in line ) . # 3 this be the big one : out all day return to my room at 10 : 45 pm , still have not be clean . speak to manager he offer to have hk clean and comp breakfast ( see # 1 ) . who have time for this ? disappointed .",0,154
"first time stay here and only stay one night before i meet up with the rest of my family . it ' s good for family and good for disney on a budget . there be attention to detail throughout the lobby and common space . large food court that be open early and late . only downfall be that the door to the room be on the exterior of the building and it can get quite noisy , especially first thing in the morning with kid run up and down the hall . the other downside be that the bed be quite uncomfortable . i walk 12 mile that day at one of the park and i be completely exhaust but couldn ' t fall asleep very well because the bed be so hard and the mattress be squeaky . otherwise , good on a budget hotel with good amenity for family .",0,154
"waaaay overprice . for the almost $ 500 ! ! i pay for one night , i be expect luxury , and get a room similar to a hampton inn , which i would have rather stayed/ save at . the ' deluxe ' queen have a poor layout ( i be expect a separate area with the couch v one big open room ) , and the wall and several area of the room be bare and boring . the public area be shut down by 11pm , which after a show at the hard rock live be disappoint . thought this be a ' rock n roll ' hotel ? ! the only thing i like about this hotel be the fact that music be play everywhere , the rock n roll memorabilia , and the slide at the pool be fun . but the room- disappointing for the expensive price .",0,154
"we have a recent trip to winter park and land two room here for a deal ! unfortunately , the room can be loud from neighbor guest . when we complain about the noise the appogized and move u right way and with an upgrade ! the room be recently redo , and it smell fresh and new . the morning free breakfast be a super saver and though we be there over the weekend , there be also a `` social hour '' with free drink and snack monday - thursday . free wi- fi in common area and hard connection in room be also nice , a be fridge , micro and stove . there be no gym but they have a conneciton with lifestyle fitness accross the highway . a very nice club , but plan on a 10 minute walk and a game of frogger cross i4 on 436 .",1,154
please don ' t stay here ! i have never be so scared in my life . i be in orlando for one night between business and vacation . the travel agency tell me all the other hotel be book . so i take what i could get . i arrive pretty late to this hotel . it be dark and i end up with the room closest to the lobby . the room be cold and uninviting . the carpet be old and dirty . i climb into bed and call a friend on the west coat for comfort . i swear to you i do not sleep a wink that night . i heard noise all night long . not to mention i think some one be go to break in all night . maybe i ' m just hella paranoid but i get a really bad vibe from the place .,0,154

"i be surprise at the number of low star review on this radisson . maybe my 4 star rating come from the fact that it be a radisson and not a 4/ 5 star hotel . the main reason for stay here be due to it ' s proximity to the orange county convention center . we stay here for 6 night and be happily surprise by the quality of the room give the very low price ( about $ 250 for 6 day a dennis mention ) . the service at the front desk be quite helpful , the bed be comfortable , the room be clean daily and i experience no issue with the wifi . i must also mention that we didn ' t eat breakfast at the hotel , a i always find breakfast disappointing regardless of where you stay and prefer to eat outside of the hotel .",1,153

"return here a year later . $ 160/ night ( convention group rate ) , plus $ 20 suite tax . decent room service food , but not a huge selection . large convention center adjacent . it be a loooong walk from the front of the hotel to the back villa suite in the last building . and only go towrd the left from there . i go to the right look for a short cut , and there be none . i be wander the back lot in the dark for a long time , until i go to the load dock of the convention center kitchen , and walk through the convention hall . it be still a hike from there to the 3 main tower . the private board room behind the upstairs bar be a good place to have business meeting for 5 - 10 people .",1,152
"it ' s not that great , but it ' s worth it for the price . after stay here for two night on the second floor , here be what i didn ' t like : the bathroom sink and shower drain stopper have to be pull out because they be bust and would just let the water fill up . the room smell funky , the hallway smell like cigarette . if you be unlucky enough to be room next to someone loud , you ' ll hear everything . the effort put into noise proofing in the place be similar to not put any effort into noise proofing . they didn ' t noise proof it . what i like : the staff be all very polite . the room be well kept and clean when we get there . they offer a continental breakfast with your stay .",1,152
"if i could give 1/ 2 of a star i would . the service be awful , staff act a if you be bother them . let ' s start with the elevator , one elevator be out of order all weekend and the other run so slow that people gather to try and fit in one elevator . the room be ok but they have sleep mattress bed that do not work and our room telephone have no dial tone . the refrigerator in the room be shotty at best , would not trust my food or drink in there . i will never be stay at this `` resort '' again , they really should review the definition of resort before advertise a one . it ' s in a prime location on i drive so it ' s quite unfortunate that this place be in such terrible shape .",0,152

"be it far from the park ? ? ? ? my answer be no , i ' m pretty sure ( i know at least i do ) we travel far when go clubbing , or head to work . so 30- 20 min drive be not , besides you be travel in company so you will feel it a short drive . clean bed , floor , drawer . overall everything be clean . the mattress very soft , my friend that always complain about her back , well she sleep like a baby and wake up feel wonderful the following day . well to wrap this up , you get what you pay for and if you be ok to pay a little more , to feel clean where you be go to sleep and have a safe surround book this place . you win ' t regret it",1,151

"stay here for 4 night in feb 2013. checkin be easy , room be clean and `` roomy '' - good size compact refrigerator in the room to store snack and drink . shuttle to disney park be so convenient ; but check shuttle schedule every day from the friendly lobby staff because time do vary depend on day and park that you plan to go to . breakfast buffet be sufficient with scrambled egg , a breakfast meat ( either bacon , sausage or hash ) , home fry , and either pancake , waffle or french toast - - they alternate meat and sweet bread from day to day - - coffee be good . order your toast and bagel from the counter , didn ' t know this until 2nd morning . overall , we have a wonderful experience here and recommend this hotel to others .",1,150
this resort be awesome ! the customer service be excellent and the option to do thing until late in the evening be plenty . the food court provide great selection for child and adult . the only flaw i have with the food court be the cashier not offer the souvenir cup during checkout since our family didn ' t know the difference from a fountain drink and the specialized cup ( unlimited refill purchase base on the day you want ) which have a chip on the bottom to determine where you can use it and how many time . the room be very spacious and open . our family love the decor overall and the heated swimming pool at 10pm be awesome . if you ' re look for a great location close to universal head over to this place and the pricing be great a well .,1,150
get a deal on trip advisory for 52 dollar . most of the staff be really nice . very convenient to shop on international drive and they have a shuttle bus that go to all the park . but they don ' t tell you that kinda find out after i pay for park the first day . room very clean . downside the breakfast buffet be terrible . toast be so hard that it wouldn ' t even break in half . egg be old and rubbery and the price be the same a the ponderosa across the street . you get wifi but you have to pay to use the business center . gym close early before five . if u want just a room with a very convenient location and pretty cheap this be the place . i ' ll probably be back but more prepared .,0,150
"we book our stay through expedia . it give the resort a 4 star rating . it be far from that . at check in , what seem to be a used car sale man , they give you a `` welcome package '' . they try to get you to sign up for a complimentary breakfast . however , they be really try to get you into a timeshare . we stay on the 11th floor , which have a filthy hallway carpet . the room smell weird a soon a you walk in . the shower be not a clean a it could be . the same night we would have check out if we could have find vacancy at another real 4 star hotel . due to it be a holiday weekend , we be not able to . i do not recommend stay here ever .",0,150
"we book a room here a couple year ago and when we arrive and check in we find that they be still clean it so we just hang out for a while and that ' s when i saw a dirty use condom in the parking lot ! ! gross ! when we finally get back into the room after they be do `` cleaning '' it we find a dirty towel & amp ; a dirty razor in the shower and food under the bed . disgust ! stain sheet , dirty shower . i could not believe it ! we quickly find a new hotel , get our money back and leave ! never to return again ! now again this be a couple year ago but i still will never return to this location or any knight inn ever again ! no star for this place .",0,150
"have a much better experience my first visit . this second visit be so so , but i be still very impressed with the location and the comfort of the bed . i make a request to have a room on a higher floor and for extra towel but neither request be fulfil . current room be a bit more dated . also , the mini fridge be useless . but , currently overlook disney spring and on disney property , you can ' t beat the price tag . i loveeeeee the new lobby . check in be a breeze . go sneak around the hotel and saw the higher up floor be be remodel , which would explain my current room and also the new pool look like it will be amazing . hot water take a minute . . . if you can get it .",1,149
"after roast the rri in dallas , i felt the need to ' balance the scale ' here , if you will , with a decent one in orlando . i stay here a few week ago purely for the reason that it be close to the occc . like , absurdly close . the low low rate didn ' t hurt either . bed be comfortable , room be `` good enough , `` and the a/ c be pump . for something in the range of $ 60/ night with free parking ( park alone at the occc be $ 15 i think ) it be completely worth it . staff be quite pleasant a well , and i appreciate the complimentary coffee in the lobby . minus one star for not have a work hot tub when it be advertised and slow- ish wi- fi .",1,149
"my wife and our two boy age 9 and 11 stayed for labor day weekend and love it . the pool be fun , we really enjoy the lazy river . the poolside grill crocs be price reasonable , food be good and the staff be extremely pleasant . the broadway deli have starbucks coffee and gelato ice cream cup for the boy two dollar with any top so they love it . we order room service for breakfast it be quick and the coffee be excellent . we have a follow up call to see if we be satisfied , we be but they have forget to send butter for the boy pancake . the manager theresa apologize and surprise the with a terrific basket of snack . theresa and any member of the staff we meet be wonderful and we definitely plan on a return trip .",1,149
"we have two teenage boy that love both park at universal . they be at the age now where we don ' t have to be with them all the time . it be nice for the wife and i to sit by the pool and have a frozen drink while they enjoy duel dragon for the 5th time . be able to walk to both park and citywalk be well worth pay $ 50 more a night for this hotel . they just remodel some room and turn out great . try to get a room on the first floor , garden view so you can walk right out to the pool or path to the park . room 1125- 1149. the pool be the best of the 3 hotel by far . i have to go down the slide at least once a day when there .",1,149

"the room be clean . it be a little rough navigating stuff for 1 handicap person , one toddler and one preschool across the parking lot , across the hotel lobby and up to our room but that be the only complaint . the pool be okay nothing amazing . love that the hotel be so close to downtown disney . my sister and i be able to slip out and leave our boy with our mom once they feel asleep . the next night we sneak downstairs for ice cream . we also eat lunch by grab take out from the 24 hour cafe . right before leave for home the whole family when to covington mill for lunch . it be fantastic ! the service be great and the food be wonderful . the chicken breast sandwich on ciabatta bread with avocado salsa be fantastic !",1,148

"a step above sleep in the car . think taco bell meet jiffy lube hotel . when we check in the first thing we notice be the clickedy- clack of the loose patio tile in the interior of the hotel . when we get to our room we do the walk through the room and the toilet seal be leak all over the floor . so we be give a new room . our new room have 80 ' s theme through out which be the only thing consistent in the decor . the pink and blue wall paper in the bath room have black mold through out . the caulking look like a two year old apply it . the finish be rub off all the furniture . in short , no i would not recommend this hotel- and no i would not stay there again .",0,148
i recently stay here for a conference . i would recommend this hotel for anyone look for nice upscale stay near disney . the service provide be good . there be a nice cafe and coffee bar where snack and treat can be purchase . other restaurant be available in the hotel . some lunch menu be limit so do your homework before decide on lunch inside . there be not a free hotel shuttle but there be plenty of service taxi wait outside . the only item i would change be the window covering in my room . they be sheer and do not block out morning sun so if you like the room dark or want to sleep in it difficult . i be there for business and have to get up early but if i be on vacation that might be a deal breaker .,1,148
"this be one of the largest ( if not the largest ) marriott in the world . it just huge . there be five or more restaurant on the property a well a a golf course , million gallon pool , and bar . that say , you ' re in orlando and there ' s so much to do outside of your hotel . everything be design to keep you on the property - such a the 400 yard walk to the parking garage from the lobby . so it have a bar there , but it expensive . the food be pricey a well . i suppose they presume that most people be there for convention or show and don ' t have car ( i. e. , stick ) . if i be visit orlando for a vacation , i would not stay here .",1,148
"do not waste your time ! ! ! get to and from the park each take an hour . they be so in efficient . this place be run like an assembly line with no focus on customer service . we wait in line for two hour to ride splash mountain but never get to ride since they only let fastpass people through and no regular line people . you pay a $ 100 only to be in the standby line . if i know that i would never would have go . i will never comeback . disney have lose focus on customer service try to milk hard work family extra money with their fastpass . if they would let a few people go through and let the regular line go also , this wouldn ' t be a problem . the strongest voice we have i",0,148
"we stay at the cascade villa for 4 night and it be a mixed experience . house keep be an additional $ 35 a day wifi / cell phone coverage be spotty . the surround amenity include a pool , a marketplace and a restaurant . pro : close to disney and universal studio . large number of store near by , once you leave the compound . large apartment style room with kitchen and appliance . pool be quiet and wasn ' t too crowd . con : expensive ! the marketplace be a complete rip off , charge double , almost triple for basic grocery and food . pool bar and grill charge $ 8- 9 for a drink a well . the restaurant where breakfast be serve look very dingy and old fashion . overall , for the price , you can do better .",0,148
"great property with good staff . room be clean a well a the entire property . i stay at the embassy suit down the street and this place be way better . the bar area be small but be still nice . chef come out and discuss the meal before i order which be cool . more hotel should do this , it ' s always nice to meet the person cook your food . the girl who be bartending be great too . one knock be the ac unit be loud and will wake you . for $ 259 they should have quieter unit . the rate be high at $ 259 but it ' s orlando airport . $ 199 be closer to what it should be but if you can get $ 259 so be it . i will stay here again . . .",1,148
"i really like this hotel . they have free wifi , high end bedding ( with fancy pillow and bolster ) , a desk with a electric strip for charge your cell and laptop and a decent size bathroom . plus they have a flat screen tv and a really nice swim pool . the hotel be very close to the airport and they offer a free shuttle that run 24 hour . we have to take a flight at 6am and we wait about 3 minute before the shuttled come . the hotel get a lot of airline staff and we actually end up go to the airport with one of our flight attendant and one of our pilot . the staff be also helpful and they have computer for you to print out your boarding pass . top notch place that be clean and safe .",1,148
"i have stay at this hotel 2xs now . not really impressed . yes it be a huge hotel . very clean and the maid check on me twice which be good . however , i find it to be very expensive . the restaurant be high and there be no free internet and they charge to use the computer and to even fax . i think that be a bit much . i would have to ride the trolly if i want to go anywhere . yes , there be lot of restaurant around the property . but , i want to have something to do a well . i need to fax and the front desk send me one place then they send me somewhere else and they want $ 3 . 00 to fax . no thank you , don ' t love it .",1,148
"fabulous room a have be describe extensively by others . however , the sound proof between room be awful . so if you ' re unlucky enough to have a next- door neighbor with child ( and this orlando , so everyone come here have child ) , then get ready for the noise of scream kid to wake you up in the morning . how be it that a brand new hotel/ time share do not take sound proof into consideration when they build it ? you will want to take this into consideration if you plan to buy into their timeshare program ( which be otherwise probably one of the better one around ) . hilton staff offer to send security to talk to the family . i also request to change room , but they be sell out so they could not accommodate me .",0,148

"have stay here before . nice , always clean hotel . include breakfast in the morning , cook to order , free internet , and drink with hot food for happy hour . this location in at the end of a large shopping area and have plenty of place to go for dinner . the onsite restaurant be a high end omaha steakhouse . i have not try it yet . the hotel be off sr436 which be a very busy road 24 hour a day . i use to live close to here 30 year ago and it be busy then and very busy now . you would think this be disney traffic . more and more business be do in the north side of orlando and this be my first choice for a hotel when i have to spend the night in this area .",1,147
"this be a gorgeous resort ! it remind me of a hotel you would find in la vega . it be all inclusive with at least 4 restaurant , starbucks , cafeteria style din too . their pool be amaze and they have a full service spa and gym which i use daily ( the gym that be ) . i be here for a developer conference . . . they do a awesome job ! every day they have breakfast , snack , lunch and a cocktail reception with food . it all be so delicious . i only go out to dinner once ( which be my last review ) and that be my only clue that i need to stick with what the marriott be serve . i surely would not mind come back here for another conference or vacation for that matter .",1,147

we be here for a conference - first time at this resort . the front desk say there be no king bed leave - huh ? isn ' t this a family place ? i would think the opposite . we get to our room and know this wouldn ' t work . i call to see if there be any way to move . thank goodness mike answer the call - he make it happen and get u move to another room asap . he send the bell men to grab our bag . now i refer to him a magic mike - great customer service ! what a great memory to share with friend and family that be consider a trip to orlando . this place know customer service ! thank you magic mike ! ! ! you make our stay 100 % better !,1,147

wow this be a tough review . first of all the place be really not very nice . really saw better day . we have a group of 5 room and every room be in poor shape . furniture be beat up . bathroom fixtures worn and stain . carpet . . . never mind . the thing keep it from a 1 star the housekeeping staff really work hard and try to keep it clean and tidy . i be really surprised because i expect le . additionally the front staff be polite . finally be be really cheap . le then $ 50 a night . so would i stay there again ? nope ! we make a mistake of prepay so we would have leave ( we stay 3 night ) but after be there it turn out okay thanks to the staff .,0,147
"this be one of the better hotel in the area . the hotel be clean and well maintain . the staff be super friendly . the amenity include conference room , free wifi , a small convenience store , pool , workout room , and vend . they also have complimentary cooky at the front desk . my room be handicap accessible and it be huge . it be very clean and the staff make sure to refresh it daily . my only complaint be i couldn ' t get the temperature below 72 degree . i like to sleep in an icebox so this make sleeping for me a little uncomfortable . i didn ' t bring this to the staff ' s attention a it be a very minor detail . i will definitely be back the next time i ' m in town .",1,147
"overall just ok. easier to deal with when you use hotwire and pay half . pool and lobby be nice but the room be date , tub drain slow , and not a clean a you ' d expect . front desk staff be friendly but please teach the valet staff proper etiquette . at the least open the passenger ' s door when use the service , especially the guy at night that stand behind the podium and just stare you down . the word resort be be use loosely , they charge the fee but where be the resort amenity ? weak wifi a refrigerator that only get cool and by the way where ' s the microwave ? if your look for an ok hotel with a big name this be the place for you , just look for the deal first .",0,146
"recently stay here on business . the lobby and public area have be remodel and be very nice . the room however . . . you might say the fall into the ' lipstick on a pig ' category . bathroom : smell like a gym ( no real ventilation ) , have old beat- up tile that didn ' t look very clean , and really have not be update . room , moderately clean and i never could bring myself to sit in the chair/ ottoman that be in the room . although , the bed be quite comfortable and the linen be very clean - thank goodness ! be sure you don ' t cut yourself on the closet door that hasn ' t be update since the 60 ' s. room service food be decent and the waitstaff be quite friendly .",0,146
"this be a nice hotel for the price . the only issue here be the management , they be just not very forward thinking and accommodate . i have several friend stay here recently and they all have a fine time , but some small request that we have ask for turn into a huge deal for the hotel and it just seem a bit strange that they didn ' t really want to work with u . when i say work with u , i should say , `` work with u so that we can spend more money at your hotel/ establishment '' and not have to go somewhere else to watch football '' . . . but overall , i really do like this place , and for downtown , i don ' t think there be any better place to stay .",1,146
"oh gaylord . what a beautiful place . come here over v- day weekend and i must admit the place be beautiful . the indoor greenhouse/ atrium in the middle of hotel be fantastic and they even have alligator , turtle , and littttle fish in the pond . there be also many choice of restaurant to eat on all different area of the atrium . the room we get be only so - so , but i guess it match the `` feel '' of the hotel . nothing too spectacular . just try to get a room with a balcony that overlook the atrium - a lot of people watch . i wish it be warm enough to go to the pool and spend more time outdoors . i would def return and spend longer than 2 day in this place . : )",1,146
"no denying that this hotel be beautiful and the service be excellent . but , let ' s be serious ! this hotel be too expensive to nickel and dime guest on silly stuff like park ( $ 19/ night a i recall ) and $ 10 in room wi- fi . the only reason to stay here be the express pas and early entry into island of adventure/ wizarding world of harry potter . but , the truth be if you get there a early a possible you should be able to minimize the wait time . also , the rest of the park be fairly empty because everyone be wait in line in the harry potter part of the park . we experience no wait for other ride in the park . gorgeous hotel . stay if you enjoy that rip off feeling !",0,146
by far . . . this hotel have the worst eatery experience . it ' s the start of college football and there be not one bar open indoors . i ' m puzzle . i check in on a friday and the sport bar be close . the only restaurant open be the italian place and it be mediocre at best . i ' ve never stay anywhere where everything be close in the middle of the day . to be force to an outdoor bar when it ' s 80 degree out just for a cocktail and something to eat . . . . bogus ! ! ! i certainly didn ' t get an advertised experience . smoke & amp ; mirror ! the second star be only because the staff here be super awesome personality . get it together marriott ! !,0,146
"i just recently stay here last week . we rent the 2 bedroom/ 2 bath . it be very nice and clean . we have a nice view of the pool . the rate be very reasonable and it be close to disney , only about 10 minute away . my only complaint would have to be , the bed be pretty hard , my back be hurt every morning but hey it a hotel so i guess that be to be expect . the only other complaint be , it a 2 bathroom condo and only 1 roll of extra tp ! and no extra pillow , we have to call down for those but they be quick to bring them up . when we check in the front desk even call our room to make sure the room be up to our expectation .",1,146
"go to see the ice show ( shrek theme ) , 70 people from china to carve it . they do a great job , but i can ' t believe they couldn ' t find people here in the state to do the work . their price be close to $ 30 per person for the ice show , no movie or the snow area for the kid ( that all cost even more ) . i be take picture inside and come with a heavy coat and glove . they give you a parka , so i warm except my hand . even with line glove the cold got to me by the time we finish . nice to see once , but i don ' t think i pay to see it again . the parking be extra too $ 13 !",1,145
"pro : the bed be very comfortable . the room have a fridge . the pool area be nice . the staff be very friendly . there be a bus to all the disney park , although it do not run all day . great location on 192 close to i- 4. con : the swing lock mechanism be break off . the hair dryer take about 2- 3 hour to dry your hair . the drain be clog in the sink and shower . breakfast doesn ' t start early enough . you get what you pay for , and we pay $ 28 a night . that be a bargain no matter where you stay , and this place be not really all that bad . i would stay here again . perfect place for a family disney vacation on a budget .",0,145

beautiful hotel and a really nice room . the location be great . i really enjoy the pool and hot tub . i would have give them more star if it wasn ' t for the parking and internet . they charge $ 10 per day for their guest to park . the main reason i pick this hotel be the location . don ' t charge me $ 70 per week to park . the other thing be the internet . that be $ 10 per day per device . it i want to use my laptop and phone it be an extra $ 140 per week . i can get free internet at macdonalds but have to pay extra at doubletree . please . . . if it have free internet and parking it would have be four or five star .,1,144

"it ' s a decent hotel within the disney world area . . . about . 8 mile walk distance to downtown disney . there be free parking and free shuttle service to the disney park every 1/ 2 hour in the morning , until 10p ( i think ) . each room have a balcony , which be nice . if you go , ask for a high floor so you can get the view of epcot . we be able to see the firework show from our room . overall , there be definitely nicer hotel that you can stay at , but for two young kid who crash every night we get back from the park . this work just fine . and we get a great deal of $ 59 p. night the weekend before halloween .",0,141
"the hotel be close to disney world , but i do not think it be within a reasonable walking distance . maybe le then a 10 minute drive to downtown disney . the room be pleasant enough , the bed be both sleep number bed , which be amaze , except one of them didn ' t work properly . do not stay in a room next to an elevator or the maintenance room , you will hear squeak all day/ night long . also some of the room have a sideview of disney world , and some people be able to see firework at night . they do have a free shuttle service from the hotel to either universal or disney world , but it be not consistent with their time , and they also go to different destination .",0,141

"this hotel isn ' t bad at all , especially for the price . the room be immaculate and spacious . the one thing negative thing i have to say about the hotel be the `` bistro '' . it ' s overprice in my opinion for what i can only describe to be `` decent microwave food '' . we place our order and sit down and within 2 minute . . . no lie . . . two minute our hot appetizer , hot sandwich and tuna salad sandwich be all deliver . with that say the food wasnt bad . if it be half the price i would have nothing bad to say about it at all , but for what we pay i would think thing could have be more `` freshly '' prepare .",1,139

"overprice , gimmicky , dingy room , worn furniture , worn bed covering , musty smell , dirty hallway , obnoxious worker at the front desk try way too hard to be cool , and that be my observation within the first half hour i be there . now the worst part : upon checking in , i notice the bed in my room have dry blood stain and what appear to be dead bed bug in the crease ( i always check before settle in ) . i complain to management who give me a hard time ( they deny it at first ) , until they offer to switch room . i demand a refund instead , for which they give me even a harder time . a crap hotel charge high- end luxury price .",0,138
"i , for one , hate find a good hotel , even with the help of review site it tend to be hit or miss . we spend five night here during a convention nearby . this have to be one of the cleanest , freshest , conveniently locate , well run , friendly , etc . hotel i ' ve ever stay at . damn do we ever sleep well on those comfortable bed . after tour around for a week post convention , we have to spend two night back in orlando . my wife demand we stay here again ! unfortunately they be book up and we stay with their sister hotel which be good , but not a good . thanks to the staff at sh suite , we have a great trip !",1,138
"this place be great ! the room be great , the staff be super friendly and accommodate , and the food be fantastic ! the monorail run right through the hotel so you can easily hop on and go to any of the attraction or other hotel with no problem . it ' s in a perfectly convenient location . i spend a week here for work and the convention center be really nice , spacious and well lay out . whenever we need something the hotel staff be on top of it immediately . our exhibitor and attendee be blow away with our convention and the venue and comment on how happy they be with everything . i definitely want to come back for a vacation here . . . if i could ever afford it .",1,138
"this hotel be pet friendly which be a plus , but they lack in other way . i call to book a massage and after be put on a 5 minute hold i hang up and call back , leave a message and never get a return call . i try to schedule a late check out and be tell i need to call back between 7- 10 be even though i place the call after midnight . there aren ' t very many thing to do late night and the hotel lay out be very odd and mostly have to walk out door to get to any common area or your room . i probably wouldn ' t stay here again unless it be free . the hard rock across the street be a lot better .",1,138
"this hotel be awesome ! i love the 50 theme . the diner be great too because it be so convenient to eat there when we get hungry . the pool be great too since there be two . my boyfriend and i get there super early and we be able to do early check- in . our room be not ready but we be able to store our luggage and get our room key . we be able to even lay out by the pool while we wait ! the staff there be phenomenal . super friendly and helpful . i recommend this hotel to whoever be stay in the area for universal ! you also get to go to universal an hour early for harry potter before everybody else , which be a huge plus !",1,138
"this place be fantastic ! ! wether it ' s for work or convention or a a base for go to universal or disney it ' s smack bang in the middle of both ! there be a complimentary shuttle that go to and from both at very convenient time . and a an added bonus it ' s walk distance to seaworld and aquatica , supermarket , restaurant . all very convenient . the staff ( especially devica ) be very helpful and the maid service be exemplary ! don ' t believe the bad review these be probably from people who be never happy anywhere ! 3 great pool a decent wee gym reasonable price for food and drink . we couldn ' t have pick a better base for our holiday of a lifetime .",1,138
"yes awesome location . the lobby be lovely and there be a starbucks in this doubletree which be great . the room be clean . the pool area stark , so frill . the pool bar be close so i order a drink at the inside bar to take out to the pool and they add gratuity automatically . so my margarita with patron be $ 14 and change and it be just ok. the reason for the three star review be the fact that on the morning of checkout the cleaning lady knock on our door ( just before 9 be ) and ask if we be check out today . i respond yes and then she follow up with `` what time ? `` i would not return to this doubletree for that very reason .",0,138
"ok the room be nice the pool and slide be amaze . the staff helpful . why only three star ? because the walk to the parking lot to the lobby be about 1/ 2 mile long , and no i ' m not exaggerate . it ' s $ 15 . 00 a day to park and walk and walk ! i also believe when you be spend this much money on a room you shouldn ' t be charge for wifi but you be . fyi the lobby have free wifi we find out on our last night , something that should have be mention when we check in , but instead be only tell about the wifi cost . a nice a this place be the parking be a deal breaker for me .",1,137
"this be a bad experience ! undisclosed , excessive parking charge . be ware of hidden $ 22 park charge . after pay this fee i have to spend over a half hour drive up and down the parking lot to find a spot . when brought this up to the front desk they be unwilling to help or offer compensation . over all the property be nice but it a bate and switch , they lure you in with a low rate , i be deceive with a rate of $ 89 just to end up pay $ 170 after resort fes , tax and parking charge that be not disclose and hide in the fine print of the booking . buyer beware ! there be many other option out there that be much better !",0,137
"nice , spacious room and lovely lake view . the coupon for area restaurant be also a nice touch ( $ 7 off breakfast at the adjacent restaurant ) . however , room don ' t have usual amenity like coffee , iron and hair dryer , which be completely strange . when we try to check in , we have to wait for this one guy to head over from his house across town . i ' m guess there ' s a tiny staff here if they don ' t have anyone on site at all time . still , we have a decent time . i ' m just not sure it be worth the cost for three night when there be so few amenity ( and nearly nothing around the area ) .",0,137
"all i can say be wow ! ! ! we get screw the first night of our orlando vacation because they over book . the good news be they put u up in a very nice hotel down the street . the bad news be that when we check in the next night we be mad that we miss out on this hotel the first night . the room be amaze . clean , plenty of space , very modern deco . the bed be comfortable , and there be nothing not to like about this place . the staff be helpful , the food service and coffee bar be awesome . this place be definatelly more buisness than family , but dont let that stop you from stay here ! i love this place ! !",1,137
"come here base on the invitation to view the vacation club . here be my pro ' s and con : pro : - the service staff be excellent and ensure you have great customer service - price for the villa be great give that a 2 bedroom can sleep 6 . - location isn ' t too far from disneycons : - the presentation be good and i enjoy the first 2 salesman assign to u ( one from tennessee ( forget his name ) but the last two `` closer '' be slimy . - only chain restaurant near the hotel - villa could be update . overall , a an affordable resort i ' d stay again but base on the service and price but some of the sale people be very slimy .",0,137
"this be the worst resort ( and i use that term loosely ) i have ever stay at . the room be list a be able to accomodate 4 but then they give u three drawer and a tiny closet . . . . so my husband and i live out of our suitcase . the pull out sofa bed be in the kitchen ! ! the room be so tiny it can barely accomodate 2 people . on top of everything , there be no daily maid service and the room stink ! it be dark , musty and simply gross . please do not go there . i don ' t ever write a bad review , but i have to do this one . . . . consider yourself warn ! ! ! !",0,137
"it be what it be , a budget choice ; so i ' m not suggest disney ' s all- star music resort should remind you of the grand floridian . however , the disney magic be pretty hard to come by . envision exceedingly basic interstate exit motel . i will say the seemingly endless hot water and spa shower head be welcome touch after 16 hour day in the orlando sun ! but the mattress be old , lumpy and thin . the bathroom so small you have to straddle the toilet to swing the door close . swap the hinge to open out , instal a pocket door or relocate the door to include the sink might help . the farthest hotel in the back have a long hoof to food and beverage .",0,137
"wish i would have read the yelp review before i book for my business trip . switch room once due to bathroom not work then have very very intermittent wifi service , no water pressure and leak shower faucet in the second room . it be a good thing i come back to the room before dinner otherwise the bathtub could have overflow after housekeep do not turn the water off completely but do close the drain . i check out a day early at the obvious dismay of management . have to escalate twice to have my refundable room ( which i pay extra for ) cancel within their cancelation policy timeline . be tell that the onsite management team would call to follow up . . . . . still wait on that call .",0,137
disney world carribean resort have nice landscaping and tropical plant all over the property . go on a busy month so check in take around 30- 40 minute . the receptionist make up for it by be jolly disney style after all it the happiest place on earth . the food area be dimly light with a couple of fast food type counter where you order and bring your food to a common dining area . this place can be very busy because of all the patron din all at the same time . there be also a separate sit down steak house with daily special . not bad . souvenir area be dot with everything disney can put thier logo on . the room be adequate and basic . shuttle bus come every 15- 30 min,1,137
"i have the pleasure to visit this ramada today and my fellow yelpers be spot on , total hellhole ! thankfully i be just visit someone because if i have to stay there , i wouldn ' t feel comfortable . this property be extremely old and rundown . there be a damp musty smell inside and it just spread throughout the hotel . the lobby area be pretty large but very outdated . from what i saw in the room during my brief visit , it your basic 1980 ' s motel room with a microwave and tv . i enter the bathroom in the lobby area and let ' s just say it wasn ' t clean . i ' m surprise they haven ' t knock this place down to build something new .",0,137
"this be the best value for the price and now i see why . the room only come with a refrigerator if you need it for insulin . there be no coffee maker or microwave in the room either . they be pack with low class people and the housekeeping be seriously an issue . one time she leave her own personal trash in our room and throw around out belonging and the day we be schedule to leave she start knock on our door at 9 be , then ten be . . . check out be at 11. the room also look like they be last updated in the 90 . terrible . the only reason i have any star be the pool and the shuttle . don ' t waste your money !",0,136
"i love stay at the hilton garden inn when i travel because it be always clean and i like have a refrigerator in the room . this hotel be in bad need of new carpet in the room . they have also put in shower stall in place of a tub/ shower . i hate shower stall . men like them- - woman do not ! you couldn ' t reach the water lever unless you be inside the stall and then you get blast with water too hot or too cold . the water control be not label either . the location be very nice and not in the middle of disney world , but close to everything . the staff be not a nice a most hgi hotel i ' ve stay at .",1,136
"good breakfast , everything else be horrible . we take a school group and stay here . when we arrive two of our room be completely dirty and dishevel , with trash in the floor and ruffled sheet ; obviously not clean at all . there be stain all over the carpet and the room do not smell pleasant . the night crew at the front desk be dismissive of u despite our politeness . we find a bb gun barrel in our room upon arrival . our trash be never empty over the course of four day . there be people openly smoke pot on the balcony at 8 : 30 be ! will not be return . stay away ! this be the absolute worst , most disgusting place i have ever stay .",0,136
love this hotel a this to me if you be a marriott person be the best hotel option in orlando . very easy to get in and out of . plenty of place to choose for din . there be usually plenty of event happen at the hotel and in the area . the different florida theme area ' s be an interesting touch and for the most part be pretty accurate . pool area be very spacious and offer plenty for the adult and kid in your group . would love to see the daily parking le ( $ 20 ) a i be not sure what this be really pay for that other hotel a the same for free . this be only only reason for a 4 star versus a 5 star .,1,136
"i find this place to be kind of gross . i would have prefer the double tree across the street except i ' m too cheap . on vacation with the family and we visit universal studio across the road . this joint be close and serve well a a flop house . i generally puke at tgif ' s and this place maintain that attitude . thankfully there be many restaurant around and with a rental car , not too far away . a part of a package deal , this holiday inn work well . just don ' t expect a four star hotel . you get a 1980 ' s style holiday inn that claim to have remodel . whoa , i wonder what kind of dump it be prior to remodel ?",0,136
i go here for a conference and it be fine by me . the employee be pretty good but i hate the extra fee to use the fitness center . i run around the pretty busy area from 9- 10 pm with path choose with help from the staff instead . i couldn ' t believe how many people be out that late on a weeknight . expect to pay $ 15- $ 20 for park per day for park unless you be handicap . it ' s nice that it be right along the $ 1 . 50 bus that take you to major attraction . the pool also look amazing but i be not sure if there be an extra fee to use it . . . food be pretty good but pricey .,0,136
"we only stay for 1 night . the room be clean and neat . . . until we decide to take a shower . . . the shower have hair in it ! ! ! so gross . we still shower though , haha . if you stay by the pool , expect music early in the morning and you can hear the people walk and talk outside your room . the pool area also smell weird and very strong . the breakfast buffett be $ 9 , we decide to eat better food somewhere else , but kid eat for free there so i think that be a plus ! it be mediocre . not terrible , not great , but we have a bed to sleep in ! isa & amp ; barrett .",0,136
"we stay here for a conference i have attend and the family come with . stay on disney property definitely have it benefit . . . the monorail right through the lobby , the character breakfast , the walk distance to mk , fun pool , great view of firework , magic hour etc , but unlike other disney hotel , there isn ' t much disney to it . the place be call contemporary for a reason . i love the newly renovate room , but i miss the family atmosphere of other resort . the food be expensive , but good . would we go back ? sure , if that be the host hotel , but if leave to my own , probably not a there be more relaxed atmosphere place around .",0,136
save your money and stay somewhere else $ 6 . 00 beer $ 4 . 00 soda and a breakfast buffet at the tune of $ 20 . 00 the egg taste better at the waffle house on the plus side the staff at the pool be on point the front desk not so much when you have 3 room for two night and 2 of the 3 have a fridge that doesn ' t work not good odds the bed be just ok pillow feel like like rock under your head room could use some fresh paint and a lot of sound proofing and the best part they wait until 10pm to verify charge that couldn ' t be verify upon check out the wifi be hit or miss . . . . never again,0,136
"we visit during the heat wave of 2011 mid july . we spend alot of our time away from disney park in the resort pool/ water park area . for the most part the resort be ok , there we no tennis court which we would have take advantage of ( in the evening ) and there be no policy to allow for u to use adjacent marriott tennis court . the room be clean and furnishing be well keep . my only complaint be that they don ' t have anyone watch the pool . in crowded pool , there be people throw ball around , eat in the pool . i saw people pour drink out in the grass . just a general lack of respect for others around them and the property .",0,136
"my family & amp ; i just stay at disney ' s all star movie resort for 4 night during our trip to disneyworld . i be very happy with the hotel . most importantly , it be very clean . the price be very reasonable for be on disney property . the heated pool near the fantasia section be very enjoyable & amp ; relax after walk around disneyworld for day ! now this be a ' value ' hotel , so it ' s certainly nothing too fancy , but if you be like me & amp ; just need a place to shower , sleep , & amp ; relax after the disney park , i would definitely recommend it ! i will definitely be stay here again on my next trip .",1,136
"this be a sad excuse for a hilton hotel . when we arrive the front desk tell u our room wasn ' t ready because they give it to a different family . apparently their water wasn ' t work in their room . they offer u a downgraded room ? ? ? how be that our problem ? why would you downgrade u ? we wait for the next room to be clean . the room be okay , look out date . the bathtub have no pressure for hot water . i have to sit there and wait for the hot water with a very low pressure . people hair be all over the bathroom , that ' s not satisfactory to me . i don ' t recommend this ghetto hotel .",0,135
"i be invite to the crowne plaza to cover a gig , and i be pleasantly surprise by the accommodation available . it ' s a good solid hotel , that doesn ' t come with the kitsch of many orlando tourist trap . it ' s decor be an odd mix of new york city life and tropical getaway , but isn ' t overdone in any aspect , i. e. , there be no miniature empire state building replica or obnoxious tiki hut to be find . the coolest thing about this place be the centrally locate glass elevator which let you oversee the entire lobby for your trip to your room . the room be pretty spacious , and the suite up top have a full bar that be nicely setup .",1,135
"beautiful hotel and ground with wonderful service . grandness come to mind when try to find a word to sum it up . from the moment we check in , i be impress with the friendly and competent service . the ' grandness ' of the lobby be prevelant throughout the hotel . the room be nice with comfy bed and bed . bathroom be spacious with separate shower and tub . restaurant on site be acceptable but on the pricey side . downside include slow wifi , high parking price , nothing much within walk distance , the shower water take forever to heat up and looong line at starbucks . very small nuisance . it be too chilly out during our visit to enjoy the pool , but they look like fun .",1,135
"find this place thru travelzoo for under $ 50 a nite . what a deal ! no parking or resort fee and super friendly staff . very decent selection for breakfast but not very yummy . good enough to get you start . the room be a bit small and bathroom cramp but after an exhausting day out at the park , who care ? the bed be comfortable and room be very clean . there be limited shuttle to disney and universal ( complimentary ) but we do not take advantage of them . it be about a 20 minute drive to disney and a 5 minute drive to universal . would recommend this hotel a it be very close to int ' l drive where there be plenty of shop and restaurant .",1,135

only give two star because at least the bed/ sheet be clean . this hotel be not worth the money at all . it ' s close to seaworld which be what we be look for but it wasn ' t the cleanest we find trash in our room when we get there which obviously wasn ' t from u . stain on our blanket . . look like the bed have be make and the floor vacuum but nothing else . and the toilet be break . the room be big which be nice but i win ' t be waste my money here again . don ' t recommend stay here . also some of the staff be not friendly at all and clearly do not want to be there .,0,133
"this be really a 3 . 5 out of 5 review . i will keep it simple so you don ' t lose interest : beautiful property inside and out with great service , wonderful pool area , and perfect location to the park . the downside be value . the basic room be outdated and do not command the $ 400 plus a night but the benefit ( early admission to the park/ perk ) pick up the slack . i feel this hotel need to be in the 250 a night range at peak and 200 and under on off peak then it would be an exceptional value . and for 400 a night a quick update wouldnt hurt ! we will definitely be back but most likely on point .",0,133
"while we be out for the day , housekeeping , or someone with a key , go through all of our bag and credit card be steal and then use . floridian hotel and thief . please dont stay here . seriously don ' t ! some best friend and i have the worst experience of our life . when we arrive at the hotel at 10 : 30 it take over an hour to get check in . the bed be hard and uncomfortable with spring jab you in the back all night . the staff be incredibly slow and unmotivated , and the `` continental '' breakfast be an hour wait for `` waffle '' . save yourself the stress and trouble . also , the orlando police department rock .",0,133
"want to get out of here in a reasonable amount of time ? we call down at 5am when we check out for the valet . they lose the car . it 40 minute with a lackadaisical attitude a we sit angry since we have a flight to catch . no one seem to care they lose the car and `` couldn ' t find the valet guy. `` overall , the stay be fine . food be nothing special and it be all over price . the ritz may be a bit more but you get what you pay for . the only thing cheaper here be the room . but , i recommend not park your car with valet if you be ever think you have a flight to catch .",0,133
"apparently the only thing more gross than the room be the front desk man ' s attitude . i call in about a personal matter and ask for his higher up . he demand loudly right away that i tell him why . the rest of the call consist of him continue to raise his voice and speak aggressively to me , a person who he hasn ' t previously speak to and have no reason to talk to that way . in fact , when you work in guest relation , you don ' t really have an excuse to talk to anyone that way , it just isn ' t good business . don ' t waste your time here , there be much nicer place to rest your head .",0,133
my family and i have be here for 2 night and we love this place . you can literally park your car and not touch it for day . they have so many thing to do on site and place to eat . we didn ' t touch our car for 2 day and it felt pretty good . the staff deserve an a+ + + + for service . before drive in we call the hotel and request a few thing ( if possible ) . when it be time to check in they grant all the request . you can ' t beat the free wifi all around the resort either . not sure why this place be get a bad rap but i would definitely stay here again .,1,132
i don ' t usually review hotel since i usually just tend to stay at the cheapest with the best rating but i love this hotel . the staff at the front desk all have fun personality and be make u laugh throughout our whole check in process . the look of the hotel from the outside a well a when we first walk in make the experience pleasurable . everything look like it be maintain daily . the restaurant/ bar inside give the hotel a bit of a glam look . the room be just a nice and i find the bed to be quite comfortable . if i could change one thing it would have be nice to have black out curtain . this place have free parking ! !,1,132
"very disappointed ! this be my family ' s 8th trip and i be most disappointed this time around . what happen to the fast pas ticket ? the fp+ line be sooo long that you need a fastpass for the fp+ line alone . my husband , son+ 1 , and i could not do a single ride in the magic kingdom due to the weird way the fp+ be set up and looong wait time at the attraction . i be ready to turn in the remain four day of ticket today because i be so angry . by the way , where be those cute little clipboard , hold disney cast member who be take the customer satisfaction survey ? they be definitely not by the park exit !",0,132
"book our reservation over the phone with michelle . she be nice but when it come to cancel it this morning it be far from good . have to call at least 5 time before someone would answer the phone . tina answer and she be horrible . i tell her we want an e- mail confirm the cancellation , that we want a cancellation number and it confirm that our deposit be return to u . that be at 9 : 23am . call them back at 1 : 30pm and tell tina that we still have not receive the e- mail . she seem not to care . it ' s now 3 : 18 and still no e- mail . don ' t waste your time or money .",0,132
"nice place , clean comfortable room , wifi all around but a few thing off the mark- - 1 ) the owner or operator own cat and on the first of two night they wake me up . ughhh ! ! i count 4 of them hang out the next morning and find their food bowl on a porch . 2 ) no fresh squeeze oj ( this be a b & amp ; b in florida ! ) and 3 ) the jelly be smuckers in those little plastic container . i expect a little more out of a b and b. in the end though , i ' ll still come back for this pleasant alternative to the typical business hotel but may bring some catnip . . . .",1,132
"we find this last minute after spend 5 day at disney . my boyfriend become sick the last day with food poisoning or virus and could not make the drive to ny . disney want $ 175 for extra night this place want $ 65 through expedia . 5 minute from disney resort . room be nice and clean , big king bed and sofa bed . only complaint : 10 minute after get settle another family open our door with their key ! ! ! ! say they be just assign to this room . totally unacceptable . only give it 3 star because it ' s cheap clean and it ' ll do for the 1 night . and the front desk lady , catherine be extremely pleasant .",0,131
"on a short notice i take my team to orlando for a lock- down work week . in order to get a good room rate for 10 - 12 people over the course of the week , we agree to some cater arrangement that be comparable to highway robbery . the catered sandwich be awful . they weren ' t `` not good for the insane price '' they be just plain not good . if subway give me a sandwich like this , i would ask them to remake it . the restaurant be great for lunch , the breakfast be grossly overprice for a buffet . the location be fantastic , the valet parking be reasonable . the pool be warm and extremely clean , even in february .",1,131
"i stay at this place primarily to be able to eat at the bob evans restaurant . the room be drab & amp ; very date . i check the bathroom & amp ; be greet by an insect in the tub . not a cockroach like the previous review but some sort of shelled bug , which i guess be an improvement for them . the linen & amp ; pillow have a smell about them that i decide to use my small travel pillow instead . when i wake up , i decide to check out , even though i be suppose to stay for 5 day . the best part of the day inn be the bob evans out front . luckily there be other hotel nearby .",0,131
"after a long day of travel , we be tell that our king size bed reservation be `` not guarantee , `` and that no bed size be ever guarantee at marriott . the hotel be pack , and i understand that king size bed may have sell out . however , my wife and i have never be treat so rudely by front desk personnel in over thirty year of travel . the manager actually laugh at my wife , and suggest that he may have to ask u to leave the hotel if we continue to complain . have it not be almost 11 : 00 pm , we would have take him up on his suggestion . if you can stay elsewhere , i strongly recommend it !",0,131
"if you have kid and want a great family vaca , this be the place . we ' ve stay at the ritz grande lake and jw marriott grande lake , both just down the pkwy from this resort , and i will absolutely be return w my daughter in the near future . it ' s a kid friendly spot - pool and amenity great for young kid - but that also lend itself to lot of activity and thus the potential for some sun for mom too . . . villa be update and roomy - flat screen in every room , appoint kitchen , comfy bed , screen porch , etc . easy access to disney world if desire . excellent value for a fun family vacation .",1,131
"this resort be really nice . the staff be very friendly and helpful . the pool be pretty big for the adult and they have an enclosed water slide for the kid at a separate pool area . oh . . . . and one heck of a long lazy river . to the left of the lobby be an open bar , zen . . . a japanese restaurant , and dave ' s cafe across from that . see my review for these place if interested . both very good . hotel be always very clean . the only downfall be that it ' s not close to much . but a great place to come to relax by the pool or play some golf on their course .",1,131
"i win ' t stay again . the first night we get here we be put way in the back . my husband be here for a conference in town and i have to tell them i be not comfortable with the location of the suite if i be come and go alone . plus trash leave outside , not a blade of grass , crack and peel paint , broken fence , unswept walk and generally gross . grant for $ 500 for a week expectation should not be too high but we have use sky auction and have several other $ 500 per week condo , but not like this . it be tolerable but not win ' t stay here or at any sunvest property again .",0,130
"wow ! for all of u marriott nerd out there , this be the ultimate . i believe this be their largest location and they do not let their size get the better of them . the lobby have 8 guest service agent , two concierge , a bellman , starbucks , two restaurant , a shop , business center and probably 100 more thing i didn ' t notice . there ' s a beautiful golf course and a few pool . we be only there for one night while we visit a friend in epcot but we could have stay there for longer comfortably . staff be all extremely friendly , kelly check u in and be great ! overall , we be very happy and impressed !",1,130
"i couldn ' t give it 5 star when the quote say `` a good a it get for 5 '' a i ' ve stay at top quality hotel but this one be by far close to 5. fresh welcoming , clean lobby and nice staff . the room be very clean and smelled fresh . the carpet be clean , the mattress be clean and firm . mostly modern feature around room . the bathroom be also very clean with spotless toilet and shower . for this be a `` pet friendly '' hotel , i be not aware of any pet dander or smell . . . the elevator be the only area that smell like cigarette , otherwise , very decent , would stay again .",1,130
"we purchase our unit year ago , when it be nice . the last time we be there we be in an old building with an 80 ' s vibe . most recently our issue have be with mailing and lack of management response to request . a an owner i don ' t appreciate receive my invitation to the homeowner association meeting in the mail three day after the meeting have be hold . management at silverlake be very unresponsive to request . they do not respond to email in a timely manner and they do not return call in a timely manner , if they even bother to call back . this resort be nice in it hey day , but i think those day be go .",0,130
"there be many residence inn around orlando . this one be , i guess , the most or the second expensive one . the reason i choose this place be because i hate blu- colored carpet that all other residence inn in orland have . i just hate it . this place cost a little bit over $ 100 per a night but it ' s worth it ! very clean , friendly service , and nice facility include nice pool , gym , rest area and etc . they offer a nice complimentary breakfast every morning and different food ( taco , chilli , bbq , and etc. ) every evening . it be my second stay in residence inn . they ' ve never make me disappointed .",1,130

"me and my gramma be drive all around florida for a road trip . it be the 3rd place we have stay it , it be probably the best place all week . there be 2 queen size bed for the two of this . the bed be so comfortable , the a/ c work perfectly , and the tv have so much channel . they have breakfast for u in the morning , it be very delicious . i have pancake and scramble egg with cheese on top . the egg be one of the best egg i have have in a long time . we sit outside , it have amazing view of the lake . overall the be the perfect hotel for some peace and quiet .",1,130

"this hotel have some very nice amenity , however i can only give it 3 star for one reason . there be a ticket desk that can help you to get theme park ticket , transportation , etc . the woman there try to get me to sit through a timeshare presentation for discounted ticket to disneyworld and would not take no for an answer . after i say no 4 time , she pass me off to another employee who be on the phone and struggle to give good service to both of u . later i watch the same saleswoman do the same thing to another guest . i find this rude , and quite shock for what be suppose to be a high end resort .",0,129
"i stay in the 3/ 2 villa and i have a wonderful time ! the villa be absolutely beautiful . it felt like home away from home ! check in and check out be smooth with no hidden fee or problem . the room be spacious and clean and the kitchen have everything we need . the location be good , it be approximately 30 minute away from universal studio and the disney park . grocery store and restaurant be approx . 10 min away from the resort . my only complaint be the bed be a little hard and the tv ' s be date . other than that it be perfect . i highly recommend this resort . a lot of space for a low price .",1,129
the most magical place on earth for child and quickly become an adult playground a well . stay on property be a must to get the full disney experience and reduce frustration while travel . best tip go early and hit the ride then leave after lunch and don ' t return to the park until after dinner so that you miss the biggest crowd and make use of the facility at your resort . we also squeeze in an afternoon nap so that everyone be ready for the nighttime fireworks back at the park . with the addition of magic band and resort guest ability to book up to three ride before you get there disney be become le of a hire and more of an adventure .,1,129
"great place . reasonably price and great friendly staff . a short walk to downtown disney and across the street from a few great restaraunts . also- there ' s a 7- 11 close by that have essential ( beer ) . the pool be nice ( and cold ! ) and the hot tub be a nice bonus . they sell park ticket in the lobby and they ' re cheaper than the park . they have a bar/ restaraunt i do not eat at . and a small work out room . i know there be shuttle to the park , but we didn ' t utilize them . you could probably just walk to downtown disney and get the shuttle there too . great place .",1,129

"positive : + caribbean beach feel like you ' re at another resort . it ' s make up of island neighborhood that all surround a big pool and lake in the middle . + clean room , while maybe not the most updated , have plenty of space and a comfortable bed . negative : - disney bus do take a while , and depend what area you ' re in , it could be a few stop before you get drop off at the end of the day . also not always a direct bus back from downtown disney , and transferring be a pain . - check in/ check out be far- you have to wait for the internal bus to go back and forth .",0,129

"why , why courtyard be you not available during my entire stay in orlando ? why would you make me suffer other accommodation ? why ? it be in your hot tub that i get to soak away the long , long conference day and mindlessly chat with my fellow guest . your pool allow me to do lap and start my pre- conference morning refresh . your bed offer peaceful night ' rest . your a/ c didn ' t whine and shake at night ; it keep the room cool and crisp . your shower have both even pressure and perfect ( hot ! ) temperature . and , you have ample parking that allow me to come and go a i please . relief .",1,128

"pageats hold at this hotel every year . ac fail . plumb fail . but the ballroom be decent , and there be plenty of parking . the pool seem nice . 89 dollar a night . . . i find a cheaper place across the street 69 buck a night , and they include a simple breakfast . if you don ' t care about a fancy pool , i suggest you stay across the street at galleria palm , they offer similar value for a lower price . they don ' t have a ballroom and a fancy pool , but they sure don ' t have ac problem or plumb fail incidence .",0,116
"if there be 0 start will rate this hotel minus 0 , we pay for 3 night , we have two kid and first night the hotel do not have towel in the room and they be available after 10 pm . second day we spend the whole day out at theme park , guess what when we come back to the hotel around 8 pm no towel , i m write now at 10 : 23 pm and no towel yest because the machine break . . . . i can not beleave it yet . so if you be plan to book at this hotel do not do it , worst hotel ever .",0,116
"if i could give it no star i would . service be awful . first hotel i ' ve ever have to sign a waiver say if i check out early there be a $ 50 charge . that should of be my first red flag . the room be so tiny . the bed be full size , the entire place be so outdated ! our room wasn ' t even ready when it say to check in at 4 : 00pm . disney would be appal ! this place give wyndham a bad name . not impressed with wyndham to say the least . marriott vistana resort hand down blow this place away .",0,116
"perhaps the dirtiest hilton property i have ever stay at . while the room certainly need a makeover , the lack of housekeeping be unacceptable ( dead bug in the bathroom , a dirty bath , no hand towel or washcloth without a phone call ) . i expect this at a $ 59/ night facility , but a a gold hilton honor member , i certainly expect better . the highlight of the stay be the singing chef make omelet , perhaps the happiest employee at the hotel . when you go to disney world with your kid , do yourself a favor and visit the local doubletree , hilton or homewood suite .",0,115
i stay here with my wife and two child for one night and i have a great time . nina at the front desk provide exceptional customer service and make and effort to make sure all our need be provide for . the room be very nice and clean . the staff on property be excellent with child and very care . there be also a kid room where my daughter be able to run around and play with toy that i wasn ' t even aware of until i get there . i will be rebooking here again and hopefully will have enough time to lay out by the poolside cabanas next time .,1,115
"simply horrible ! nothing like the photo . . . room be tiny , pull out bed have a mattress a thin a a cracker , upon check out day we tell the house keeper not to clean our room we still have thing to collect from our room and need 10 minute . when we come upstairs for a final check of our room there be two men from house keep throw our stuff away and wear my boyfriend ' s sun glass . when we complain at the front desk the rep response be i will notify the housekeeping manager and that be that . we be beyond shock . never again .",0,115
here for mega con . the room be nice but there be no fridge . red roof cost $ 30 le w fridge but be full . not enough park stall for customer even with the 1 car rule . check in be easy and she be nice . bed be comfortable . but the ac vent be to close to the bed . have to put a chair between so the air wont blow on my face . but overall it ' s a average inn . $ 100 a night be kinda steep for this place but you be pay for the convience on how close it be to the convention center .,0,115
"my mother be contact by hilton to come to a time share presentation that would grant u a free 3 night stay . unfortunately for u , if you be live with a `` significant other '' or `` cohabitating '' that the partner be require to be present even if they have absolutely no say in her decision or input on her financial decision . this result in her have to pay over 500 $ for the room . it be a lovely room with a great view , but apparently they discriminate against people in relationship , even if they have no legal right to any money that the other person have .",0,115
"the hotel/ resort be pretty much an older hotel locate in orlando . the hotel itself be in good shape . if i could rate it a 3 . 5 , that ' s the review i would really give it . the staff be very very helpful and sweet . the rental for one night be at 135 . 00 plus a 22 . 00 resort fee . the room be fairly clean and tidy . the bathroom have no water mildew buildup or rust . overall , i have enjoy my stay at this hotel . although it wouldn ' t be my first pick when go to a hotel in orlando .",0,115
"my family just have a family reunion in orlando and the staff at the residence inn be very friendly and go out of their way to make u feel welcome . upon find out that it be my grandmother ' s birthday , the hotel manager put streamer up in her room and leave her a very large chocolate cake . . . without anyone ask them to do so . the hotel have a nice bus that will take you to epcot . the room be clean , well furnish and decorate with exquisite art . the pool be shallow and relaxing and the bar be serve free beer when we be there .",1,115
wow i could say so much but i will try to be short . the front desk office smell like weed to start and the room wasn ' t ready when promise . the room be tiny with dirty carpet and sheet . the bed be so uncomfortable and could barely sleep with it thin comforter and one pillow . there be always a ton of people be loud in the hallway at any give time . good stuff ? the price and the fact it be close to where i need to be . it be in a nice part of town . it be also equip with a range and fridge .,0,114
"need parking to attend a conference and discover the self parking rate be $ 10 with no in and out privilege . want to eat lunch somewhere other than the pricey hotel restaurant , just add $ 10 to your lunch tab for return parking . but there be workarounds . if you enjoy walk there be free park at the office building right at the turn off to the hotel . once in the hotel lot there be 30 minute of free parking , so on the way to your car hit the button for a fresh ticket , exit through the self service gate , and you be on your way .",0,114
we book two room for a weekend stay while visit the universal theme park . the major plus to this hotel be it location and proximity to both theme park . we be able to walk and not have to worry about parking . the lobby and room have be recently update a well and be in good appearance . the park area be quite confusing a it take a while to figure out how to get in and out of the lot and it wasn ' t cheap either . the bar area of this restaurant appear to be very disorganized and customer always seem to be wait for drink and service .,0,114
"visually this be a beautiful hotel and conference center . a few note to consider when we check in the transition wasn ' t smooth valet be short staffed and back log , and would not allow curbside sign in without offer valet . another area be the room in comparison to our stay at hilton , we be surprise to find that their standard room of amenity , mattress , pillow , robe , towel , tv , to be of lessor quality for the price comparison of bonnet creek . . . the gym access be also limited to 5- 10 , while we be more in need of 24hr access .",1,114
"this be middle of the road . . . the room be not bad , the facility be great . the negative be that the tv be not work for most of our stay and we miss the ncaa final . there be a pretzel in the corner of the room the entire time , and we didn ' t eat pretzel in the room . i wonder if it would ever get clean up , and now i wonder how long it will stay there . parking , food and drink be expensive , but we just eat off property . perfect location for folk go to the park and city walk .",1,114
"moderately clean room . lack of hot water . i call the front desk regard the water and the response be `` the hot water come from the top floor , so just let it run for 10- 15 minute '' . . . which sound kind of silly for a hotel that be suppose to be this `` nice '' . i do try this method , but it didn ' t work . in room coffee be crap , you just get the standard packet with 2 sugar and a sweet n low . who use sweet n low any more ? ? ? the bed be very comfortable at least .",0,114
"fantastic resort ! ! we be stay here a i be texting this for 11 day . . 6 day have pass and we be more then satisfy with the very friendly staff , great housekeeping , the breakfast buffet be the best i have ever see or have ! everything be make fresh right in front of you and you pick what you want in omelet , and pancake . you have to try shade of green ! ! ! you win ' t be sorry . . . . i be not affiliate with them in any way , and i live in maryland . i will definitely stay here agian !",1,114
stay at diamond in sedona and buy a sampler package with stipulation we hear their high pressure sale pitch one more time when we use point at mystic dune in orlando . the salesperson be very honest and explain that diamond sampler package get u a room in their worst complex ( think warsaw pact construction ) and that we pay triple the go rate . he then explain by fully buy in and be a premier diamond owner that we would then be treat well . if you be a sampler package participant just eat your loss and don ' t stay at mystic . there be plentyof great golf resort in orlando,0,114
i be in the north tower and the noise from the outside vent be exceedingly loud and the sound proof on the balcony door non existent . my room wasn ' t clean for 2 day even though i do not have the privacy sign on the door . a loud banging noise be intrusive and although i alert the front desk to this twice no one be ever send to the room . the internet didn ' t work for over 24 hour and since i be attend a work conference this be extremely inconvenient . a a frequent marriott guest this be an appalling experience . take your business elsewhere .,0,113
beautiful resort great place to stay awesome that it ' s gear to all our service member . great value for what you pay . so nice to relax pool side and enjoy the day spa . go to the disney park be easy bus come very few minute . very nice room nice view . they also offer an extra 20 percent of room and food if your service member come back from deployment with in the last 12 month and have be deploy longer than 260 day . we take advantage of that it come and handy and save u some extra money . we will decently stay there again .,1,113

"this hotel ( i consider it a motel ) be once a howard johnson and it be currently be renovate . the hotel staff be friendly and helpful . the hotel be currently in transition and my room have new furniture and a nice lcd tv . however , the air conditioner be noisy and old . we stay there because our company book it , and it be near the convention center ( we be there for a tradeshow ) . my co- worker have to battle bug two night in a row . let me put it this way , i would not recommend this hotel to a family member .",0,113
great place to stay in downtown orlando . i have read some previous review before arrive and they be spot on ! when arrive it do feel like a `` w '' hotel here in the atl . very trendy atmosphere ! the room be really great but the bed be outstanding ! typical hotel bed be definitely not this comfy . i love the little sample soap and lotion in the bathroom . i ' m kinda a snob like that due to my youngest feel like i bring him these a gift from my travel ; ) all in all great place ! i would stay here again anytime .,1,112
"nice location for disney visitor and people with kid on vacation . the pool have a lazy river and water slide and make for a good day to relax on site . the regular bus service to all of the close disney park and marketplace make it easy to get around without need our own car ( other than for universal. ) la luce restaurant be great food and the bistro be kid eat free breakfast and dinner . bar service at poolside could have be better/ faster but then again it probably save me some $ $ $ . all in all , we like it and would go again .",1,112
stay at this hotel for 3 night for part of our honeymoon . i enjoy our stay . the hotel be clean except for the one hallway go out the back smell like curry . the staff deserve a 5 star . everyone be very friendly and helpful . the reason im give a 3 star be because the house keeper get some bleach mark all over my husband clothes . ruin 8 shirt and a hat ! we be reimburse by the housekeeping manager even though they have no proof it happen there . but why would we bring 8 shirt and a hat with noticeable bleach stain all over .,1,112
"my stay here be not very comfortable . i like the layout of the room which have a furnished kitchen , live room , and two bedroom but there be a strange smell to the room , i wake up to smokey/ dry air , the mattress seem pretty old , the sheet weren ' t that great , and so many other little thing . i could list forever thing like find a hair on the clean face- rag , find small red stain- spot on the pillow cover , dirty corner , thing like that but i will spare this place because i live and it purpose be fulfil .",0,112
"this be by far the best hotel of this caliber and price point i ' ve stay at . for $ 100/ night , we stay in a king suite with a separate sit area . the entire hotel be clean and relatively recently remodel . the hotel staff be incredibly helpful and friendly , with everything from suggest restaurant to call cab and hold our luggage for the day ( we weren ' t leave until 6pm even though check out be at noon ) . bonus point for the complimentary continental breakfast and the citywalk coupon they give u . we would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat .",1,112
"we end up book at the hyatt orlando through hotwire because the cabana bay beach resort couldn ' t accommodate u an extra night . the room be big and spacious and i have a great night ' s sleep . check in and check out take le than a minute . after check out on our way to the park we realize that we have leave my son favorite pillow , i call in and they hold it for u to pick up later in the evening . i highly recommend the place , it ' s affordable , clean and you can get a great night ' s rest .",1,112

"beautiful hotel with exquisite ground . the pool be fabulous . . . and heat which be a nice touch since we go in february when it be in the high 60 . the hotel have starbucks , and a few restaurant that be right on sight which make it easy for all the guest . you also share ground with the ritz which be also quite lovely . the room be beautiful . the decor be tranquil and clean . turn down service be fabulous . they also offer 24 hour room service which be always so wonderful . the bed be extraordinarily comfortable . it be a great experience !",1,112
"this be a really bad hotel . bad a in old , rundown , beat up and smelly . the outside look decent and the lobby be acceptable but the room remind me of a motel 6. i ' m fact i have stay at better look motel 6. everything in the room be stain . . . rug , chair , couch , bathroom floor , wall etc . . . make you wonder what have happen in these room and it feel nasty . hilton should sell this property , close it or renovate it because continue to operate it the way it be just tarnish the brand .",0,111
nothing special . stay here for our honeymoon . it be good for a place to sleep . the decor of the room and overall hotel ground be cute . there ' s a nice trail around the lack to run and walk on . the staff be always helpful . the ground be always clean . good food selection on ground . bus run a lot . only issue be that there be so many stop within the hotel ! they always send extra bus when the stop be crowd . a little disappointed the bike and sureys cost extra . it should ' ve come with hotel price !,1,111
"i be stay at this hotel for a conference and i must say that they offer a lot here ! great room for seminar and larger meeting , cozy room with great cleaning service , onsite fedex , roughly five bars/ market , disney ticketing service , large pool deck , updated fitness room , and a cute boutique ! i would say some of the room and area need some modern updating and naturally price at these venue be steep ( $ 4 for a can of tea ! ) , but overall an enjoyable stay ! the walk to disney spring isn ' t long and rather nice !",1,111
"i stay here for the first time memorial weekend . i be visit with my daughter . we find the room very clean , spacious , bed be comfy . the free breakfast be a bonus though my daughter miss her french vanilla creamer for coffee , but we purchase some at a local store and keep it in our refrigerator . the staff be helpful and friendly , and there be a nice pool . the only complaint be that racoon be run around the parking lot at night and one look like it want to attack u a we be walk back to the hotel from our car .",1,111
"the price be right ( we get a suite w/ multiple room much cheaper than what our planned alternative , shade of green , be offer ) , the courtesy shuttle be timely , and there be a lot of on- site amenity . downside ? our bedroom be directly above the outside bar , which mean there be a lot of loud music . i can ' t complain too much , i don ' t recall it be loud past 2200 or so , but then i ' m a early- to- bed kinda guy . also the room smell strongly of fish when we check it .",1,110
"surprisingly nice find of a hotel near sea world , disney and the convention center . clean , bright , and new , the fairfield win ' t be confuse with the more upscale peabody , but hey , you ' re pay about $ 100 a night ! this be a value proposition ! with a tgifridays next door , a denny ' s a few door away , and a mini department store of a cv in the parking lot , this centrally locate fairfield be a terrific find for both family with kid a well a business people on a budget . nice staff , too !",1,110
"terrible hotel to stay in ! ! ! ! be a faithful guest for 6 year during our yearly trip to orlando . i be here right now and i have ask the poor lady in the front desk , faith ( sweet but overwork ) , for extra blanket and have to complain about the bed in our suite 2 night in a row . also , we first arrive to no air condition in the room but thankfully that get fix by the middle of the night ! ! overall not worth the money . really sad to see this hotel decline over the last couple year .",0,110
"i haven ' t even stay at the hotel yet but it ' s be a headache to book or modify reservation . for a large scale property it take a long time to get answer or get anything do . my bos be stay there for a conference and it take a week to confirm receipt of a food/ bev contract , 10 min on hold ( twice ) to modify a standard room reservation , and be transfer 3 time to get an answer on a restaurant reservation where the woman tell me she `` didn ' t know '' why i be give 2 confirmation number .",0,110
"we spend last weekend at liki tiki for my daughter birthday . they have a great water park , mini golf , bike and peddle boat so the kid have ton to do . we rent a 2 bedroom and it be very spacious , a little outdated but i think some room have be redone . there be a full kitchen so you don ' t have to eat every meal out . all of the staff that we encounter be friendly and very helpful . the ground be very nice , well landscape and clean . all in all a very nice place to spend a weekend .",1,110
"third time stay here , amaze ! plenty of space for two adult and two kid , super clean , friendly staff , quiet , beautiful lobby and amenity , just the perfect hotel . we love it and can not wait to go back ! the only con be the self- parking fee of $ 22 per day ( pretty ridiculous imo ) , but that ' s the case with any upscale hotel in orlando . also , the resort fee should be include in the price and not tack onto the bill a a `` hidden '' cost . besides this however , well worth it !",1,110
we experience a clean and secure room . the attendant be friendly . we have no problem what so ever with our stay . alessandro need an attitude adjustment though . we have the pleasure of meet him at checkout . . . . i leave feeling a though i owe him something and have forget about it . good little convenience store right in the lobby and the buffet for breakfast be top notch . walk distance to many thing to do after dinner and some interesting shopping . we will stay there again next year . it will be interesting to see if alessandro be still there !,1,110
"i ' ve be to disney before and i ' ve stay at pop century , beach club and bay lake . this time we stay at the boardwalk and win ' t stay here again . you buy the refillable mug but then you have to walk half a freak mile to the bakery on the boardwalk to fill them . don ' t get me wrong i love visit the shop and place on the boardwalk but would not stay at the boardwalk again . we enjoy pop century more than this hotel but by far , in my opinion , be beach club be the best .",0,110
"we stay here for 4 night last week with a family of 4. although the staff be quite good in term of service for the most part and the property look nice , we would not stay here again a they seem to have clean issue . sheet smell musty , silverware at breakfast be not clean well . we could see hair on our bathroom day after day . they definitely need to step up their game . honorable note to concierge scott who do do a great job help u get the disney park time plan out and purchase . also the hot tub be quite nice .",0,110
"come to visit disney for one day for my daughter ' s birthday and they want to schedule their presentation that day ( dinner time at that and want 2 hour of your time ) instead of the the next day or before ! call in to try and change it and they claim they can ' t ? ! horrible , horrible customer service . ruin not only my daughter ' s experience of disney ( try explain to a 3 year old the reason for leave unexpectedly ) . . . . just such an awful birthday vacation memory . most definitely disappointing to the max .",0,109
"wyndham buena vista be very accommodate to my extremely large group ' s 3 night stay . we have unhindered access to the activity of the hotel , and when combine with the proximity to disney spring ( a well a the incredible guest service of our representative brandon ramirez ) , this trip be better than those i ' ve take to chicago , new york , and other destination with the same size group . whenever we need something ( towel , etc. ) , i never have to wait more than 10 minute to receive it from friendly staff . i strongly recommend this stay .",1,109
"celebration be everything that ' s wrong about florida concentrate into a very dense area . you arrive say `` what have i do ? `` . then if you be book at the baymont you find a nice enough hotel tuck back in palmetto and myrtle oak drip with spanish moss , a perfect place to hide and pretend you be in florida and not `` florida '' . palatial lobby , friendly staff , nice courtyard and decent enough room for 40 buck . i don ' t really care that the paint be old and a lightbulb be out . i would stay here again .",0,109
"i stay here for a conference because i refuse to pay the outrageous price at the host hotel ( marriott. ) the hotel be clean , well lay out , and the bed comfortable . the staff be friendly and allow me to check in very early . i really appreciate that . it be near a shopping center with a large number of restaurant but , not within walk distance . what be odd , and maybe because they be near disney be that the restaurant/ bar be pretty well desert except for breakfast . all in all , a good stay and i ' ll return .",1,109
"have a good stay here . nearly unmatched proximity to epcot , which , in my opinion , be the superior park of the bunch . . . especially for nighttime jaunt - - can walk right over to epcot , stop through the boardwalk , drink and eat all along the way . can ' t hate on that . quick and easy transportation to hollywood studio , a well a both magic kingdom and animal kingdom . good hotel for the fam for all of these reason . might be a little pricey , but so be everything in disney . great value on location here .",1,109
"spent an evening at the renaissance orlando a few month ago . it be a decent hotel for the seaworld crowd . the first thing to notice be the lobby which be huge and decorate like you ' re outside , but you ' re actually inside , something that only epcot can pull off a well . the one thing that really suck be that all of the parking here be pay , so you no matter where you go you have to either do the valet or the pay lot . the room be very nice , big and nicely decorate with couch and lounge chair .",1,109
"terrible hotel management becca be probably one of the worst front desk manager ever , she be unbelievably rude ! i don ' t know how she become a front desk manager she have no compassion or management skill at all ! also be lie to by her . very unprofessional . i would have get better treatment if i ' d stay at a motel 6. i check out of the portofino bay and move here . . . . huge mistake . worst hotel experience i ' ve ever have from a 5 star hotel . i would have rat it zero star if i could .",0,109
"i guess the biggest draw about this hilton be it on the disney property , across the street from downtown disney and pleasure island . it an older hilton , our conference be at a newer convention/ complex . the hotel sort of show it age . but i wasn ' t there on vacation , rather business . it a $ 60 cab ride from the airport - better to grab a mears shuttle . it have a couple high end restaurant in the building , a pool and lot of disney theme stuff . they charge for parking and there be disney shuttle to the park .",1,109
"this be quite possibly the worst hotel i ' ve ever stay at . first thing i notice be that the main light when enter my room be not operational at all , and with good reason . there be stain all over the furniture and carpet . the bed be beat to hell a if it be once populate with a $ 5 . 00 whore on a saturday night . the staff be friendly , and location be meh a there be currently major street construction go on . still though , i ' d have felt more comfortable stay in an open bay military barrack .",0,109
"visit this hotel on our last trip to disney . very convenient location , right across from downtown disney . the concierge be very helpful , they help u find last minute ticket to cirque du soleil . the staff be courteous and pleasant . we receive complimentary breakfast buffet at the cove mill restaurant and be excellent ! on sunday we be able to see minnie and pluto ! . our bedroom be really comfortable and the bus service be way better than have to drive to the park ! . oh and this hotel also get the extra magic hour at the park ! great perk !",1,109
ok so out of all the hotel and motel i ' ve ever stay in for the past 2 decade of my life i have to say this be the worst hotel . 1. take over 30 minute to check in cause they could not find our reservation . 2. no towel for 2 days3 . i rather they stop serve their continental breakfast it ' s literally bread and water . . . . 4. don ' t want to charge your phone or blow dry your hair ? come here . none of the plug work . 5. dirty carpet . dirty room . dirty everything .,0,109
wait in line to buy park ticket suck . very slow service because that lady assign there be take so much time in sell time share . i tell her i ' m not interested on it but still push . she on her waste everyone ' s time . maybe management can look on this issue because that probably not of the hotel mission to all the consumer out there . so dont waste your time in line . the sad part be that she do not only cover park ticket but also shuttle bus transportation too . get ready for the long wait . just say .,0,109
"can here in november 2015. this place be not worth the price you pay for . the service be not the `` disney experiece '' i be expect . the sheet and towel be not always clean . despite tip on the bed every day and request for extra towel and toiletry , never get any from the assign maid , so i have to call the front desk every day that we stay . basically a disney theme motel 6. if i ever come back to disney world , i will either stay at a more upscale hotel , or go outside of the disney resort .",0,108
"my wife and her mom stay for two day while at a craft expo . there be an unusual charge on her credit card . when i call to check on this , i get the usual automated message , `` we ' re currently experience unusually heavy call volume , please call back '' . what that mean be that they don ' t have enough customer service rep to service their customer . many company be do this to save money . it save them money and cost you time wait for someone to answer . next time , she ' ll stay somewhere else .",0,108
"so far so great ! this be my first time ever book a hotel . but i have no trouble get check in , they only have a very small authorization hold , she tell me all the information , the room be ready and clean when we get there . i haven ' t go to breakfast yet , but it sound like they have a nice variety on their menu provide in the room . no problem with the room key , the coffee in the room be pretty good . mini fridge in the room be awesome ! i would definitely stay here again !",1,108
"im go to orlando ? really ? when ? tomorrow ? oh . i need a room then . i book at the cwr le than 24 hour before i actually check in and pay around $ 50. no other fee , free internet , free parking , but a little far from the park . a- ok. the room be clean , everything be in order . little fridge , microwave , a little table . comfy bed . the pillow however be almost non- existent . not good cause i like to hump mine when i sleep . no . im kid . seriously now .",0,108

"we have a great time at shade of green . it ' s very family orient . they have so many activity for the kid . it ' s very convenient that it ' d on the disney property , but not disney resort price . they have shuttle to go to the park to and from the hotel resort . your room price be base on your rank . we have a great time they have a pool and hot tub . every night we go to the cafe to get ice cream , which be soo good ! definitely will be go back .",1,106
"hard to review this hotel with star . they do not claim or pretend to be five star . they be clean , quiet , friendly , honest and extremely fairly price . so it be not five star vs top notched luxury hotel , but a great value which go a long way . price even include a simple breakfast buffet . beware of a silly $ 3 . 50 `` resort fee '' . small enough to pay and not complain , but not expect after you bid a price on priceline for a 2 star hotel . worthy to mention here though .",1,106
"this be a great place to stay when you be on a budget . don ' t stay at another hotel that be off the property that be $ 60. even though this might be $ 100+ , it worth it because you don ' t need to drive anywhere or pay for any parking . plus you can hang out at all the other hotel , go to the park early , etc . . . we always stay here and then hang out at the grand floridian . why pay the grand floridian price when you can stay here and use their stuff ?",1,106

this be a nice place to sit stay for what it be . it be a timeshare resort . you will get a condo . you will not get make service deli . you will not find a bar to go to at night . you will not find a lifeguard at the pool . you will find a very comfortable accommodation for very reasonable price . you will find that the location be beyond incredible for go to the park . just make sure you take the phone off the hook because you will be get phone call every morning to take their tour,1,105

this hotel host loud party . on the 15th floor the sound be over 100 decibel . think bongo drum non stop . it have be over three hour . front desk and property manager `` brian '' can not fix it . it be a `` marriott international '' party . a party for themselves and they be not considerate of the other guest stay there . if you want to swim and pay the resort fee to do so then too bad . check out early . i be a loyal marriott guest with over 650 night - very very disappointed .,0,104

"well , the thing be , when i walk into the bathroom , my first think be who didn ' t wash properly between their cheek but since the smellwas imbed in the shower curtain , i conclude that the previous guest must ' ve bent over and didn ' t realize that they `` perfume '' the curtain with their tushy odor . the only other plausible explanation be that a previous guest do a `` dip and sniff '' and try to hide the evidence ; unfortunately , the shower curtain continue to smell of tuchus long past the actual event .",0,104
my wife and i be celebrate our 26th anniversary and i book 2 night there . the free wi- fi be only in the lobby . the king size bed have 3 very small pillow and when i ask for more they need authorization from the manager first . we never get them . i book a 2 night stay and we leave after the first night . it a wonder that this place even operate . do not believe the picture ! ! by the way the refrigerator leak water on the rug constantly . you do get what you pay for .,0,104

"it ' s not really the proximity to the county jail or the bad smelling room that be my biggest problem with this hotel . even if you pre- pay on hotwire you show up and they charge you a non- negotiable fee for use of the pool and gym that even the friendly receptionist agree be `` kind of sneaky. `` speaking of , the pool area be way sketchy and `` gym '' be barely that . to call this hotel `` downtown '' be really false advertising . the lobby be really big and beautiful though .",0,100
always a great place for great price . close to everything on i drive but nestle away from all the busy and craziness . great restaurant and great atmosphere . the market place be cozy and great . the pool be great too . the clubhouse grill have one of best burger and the land remember restaurant have amazing steak . you feel like you be okay a resort far away from home and everything . very secluded but still close to everything . great hotel for family time or chillin with friend or a just a romantic weekend .,1,100

this hotel be very reasonably price for a resort . you can get a room with a whirlpool tub ( big enough for 2 ) . i would ask for a room in the renovated section and a room face sea world . if you get lucky you can get a room face the sea world firework which be really cool to watch at night . why only 4 star ? there be no where on the property to get dinner ( unless you want pizza ) . thankfully there be ton of restaurant and a publix close by .,1,100
"nice , clean , good sized room , no complaint , perfect location for what we need , a well a the right price ( thanks to of course ) . the only complaint be you need your room card to get in and out of the parking lot of the hotel . to get in , i understand . you don ' t want some randos fillin up the spot for the guest . but to get out . . . in the couple day we be there , it never work . what ' s the point !",0,100

"room be very outdated , the fridge be set so cold everything we put in it freeze . the cleaning staff be very slow and do a poor job . we do not receive new shampoo and conditioner bottle during the stay . the pool run out of pool towel and no one check on it for the 2 hour we be there . only stay here because it be for a wedding , this hotel be cheap , and they want to make sure their guest know it . oh , and the elevator be so slow ! !",0,100
my family be there recently for five day basically it be a place to lay our head . the staff be very friendly and most of all it be close to the theme park we go to . the pool be always clean . the staff need to do a better job with clean a lot of rust be also in our room . the bedding be not change and the breakfast at 9 . 99 be not worth it . it actually suck unless you have something make on the grill . the wifi be also super slow .,0,100
"while the room be spacious and the location be good , we be not please with our stay for the following reason ( we be spg platinum ) : half a dead cockroach on kitchen floor on arrival . hotel management control ac centrally at night , result in warm sleeping condition no matter how you set the thermostat . we ask for `` green choice '' but the housekeeping come anyway . multiple request in order to get coffee replenish in room . shower head desperately need to be change . minor billing request not accommodate by manager .",0,100
"stay at a resort here and go to the `` magic kingdom '' . horrible experience with rude `` cast member '' at and on the bus and the resort double the price of purchase with a `` travel '' charge and mandatory 20 % tip . sound like the unhappiest place on earth if you ask me . by the way , nothing magical about their magical express shuttle tithe airport . . . take forever and you ' re better off use cab or a rental car to get around if you value your time at all .",0,100
"you ' ve prolly heard , there be a duck parade here . . go check it out . . great convention space . there be 2 tower of for hotel room . get into the new tower . it nicer . there be bar with a patio , sorta overlook the pool . . the patio be a good place to smoke a cigar . . i can ; t remember a thing about the food . . i do remember have a cigar every night there for 5 night and the service be attentive and professional . .",1,100
"solid 3 star experience . pretty inexpensive , especially in comparison to other hotel in the area . room be a little old feeling but comfortable . convenient location a it be within walk distance of a bunch of restaurant and bar , a well a the convention center . only somewhat negative thing be that the wall be pretty thin so you may get wake up by the scream child who be play in one of the swimming pool . i would probably come back here again if i come for another conference and be on a budget .",0,100
"love stay at this hotel ! certainly three star ! the staff be so friendly in make sure you enjoy your stay . each room have a mini fridge , microwave , super cold air conditioning and comfy clean bed . the housekeeping staff do a fabulous job and the breakfast from 6 : 30- 9 : 30 be excellent ! the wall be thin , but that be one of the only con . it be close to disney world , right by walmart , and have many food option around . great stay - thank you !",1,99
"nice hotel , close to universal and not too far from disney . 1 negative that have be mention already be it depend on when you go . this be a major convention hotel and a few day in our stay , this place be cover up . we have to park a good half mile away from the hotel , something that you don ' t really want to walk after walk around disney ' s massive park all day . good hotel , but would most likely not stay here again due to the parking situation .",1,99
"tough week for the crown plaza . only stay 4 night , felt like an eternity . water shut off for hour two separate day . air condition keep the room at a not- so- cool 84 degree , and the toilet in room 1107 leak from the tank and flood the bathroom . then there be the water main break that cause a deluge in the lobby . huge hole in the ceiling , water drip into a bucket . sorry to say that on this particular stay the crown be not exactly fit for a king .",0,99
these people be clearly talk * * * * in the comment below . . the worst place i have ever stay at ! ! i have to switch room at 12 at night because it ' s right next door to a restaurant that apparently be a club after 8pm . the shower be clog . we call for towel they never show . . call again and the guy tell u oh sorry i forget . . . . i mean it doesn ' t get any worse then this place people i be warn you .,0,99
"my husband and i travel a lot and have make an art of find cheap hotel . sometimes they turn out great and sometimes notsomuch but they ' re always a cheap place to sleep , shower and get back on our way . this one be definitely a great find ! the price be great . the room be clean and very comfortable . the internet be fast and reliable . parking be plentiful and easy . check in and check out be a breeze . it definitely rank pretty highly in my list of budget stay .",1,99
"so we don ' t have kid - but if we do this resort be the place to be ! great pool , lot of activity , great location for universal resort . more kid friendly than the loews portofino which be a little more upscale and have a spa but a smaller pool . must check out the luau which they have some evening - not every day you get to see a pig with an apple in it ' s mouth . the room be nice and the breakfast buffet in the orchid restaurant be great !",1,99
"my experience here be very pleasant ! easy parking , access right off the highway . check- in process be simple and quick . the front desk be so helpful and even give u a voucher for breakfast the next morning . room be i would say a normal size a well a bathroom . hotel be very clean and all staff include housekeeping be friendly . i would give this location 3 star because unfortunately the bed be not very comfortable and the pillow would flatten completely when you put your head on them overall good experience !",0,99
"runned down , need maintenance bad . furniture be badly worn , bathroom at truck stop quality , slow drain , paint peeling , door track jam , simply need rehab bad ! breakfast be ok , much better at other residence inn . overall not nearly the quality expect from residence inn . also , there be a shuttle to epcot only and it a very limited schedule , 3 time a day . the shuttle look and feel like it spend the previous 20 year work parking at the airport ! it a piece of junk .",0,99
hotel definitely not take care of . a/ c noisy and barely work . cabinet and door peel and damage around the edge . room be a 6 of 10 on cleanliness . not gross but apparent that housekeep take little if any pride in there work nor do it seem that management be concern about quality . elevator look like freight elevator . . . slow and in need of repair/ cleaning . breakfast be ok if you want waffle and old fruit . 5th floor smell like an ash tray . staff be polite and friendly .,0,99
"the room seem a bit small , and the door be a bit noisy ( let in all the noise from the kid in the hall outside ) . the bed also seem a bit small for a queen . the room didn ' t have a desk ( it do have a table , but no power near to it ) . also , very minimal clothes storage space ( drawer ) . so , it seem the hotel spend more time worry about the decoration ( very nicely do ) than the usability of the room .",1,99
"for starter this be my 2nd time stay with towneplace suite but my 1st at this location ( flamingo crossing ) . the hotel be new , and most importantly clean and affordable ! customer service from the staff be great . greet you with a smile and hello , day or night . i highly recommend stay here . my original reservation be for 3 night but i extend it and stay for 6 night total . if i ' m in the orlando area again i will definitely have them at the top of my list .",1,99
"very nice building on the outside and inside , everything be modern and up to date . the `` kick back '' be the best ! where else can you get 1 . 5 hour of free food and 3 drink ( yes alcoholic too ) per night ? this be a very good bonus , something i didn ' t know until we check in . fitness center be clean and maintain , the staff be super friendly and the food be good , throw in free wi- fi and you have a very good overall experience .",1,99
if you want a great suite ask for 10101 or 9101. the window to the left have a view up i- drive to o- townthe window to the right be a nice view over sea world . i be there for a convention and i do have a little status with marriott . but no one there know that and they treat me great and everyone i encounter be extremely happy to help me . any request i have there be someone to full fill my need . i hope i get to attend another scct there .,1,98
if i could id give no star . the staff be terribly unprofessional . i call to cancel a reservation and the man on the other line decide it be okay to yell back that it have already be cancel . i can not believe someone could be so rude over the phone to a complete stranger . consider i be look forward to stay at this location im glad i do not . myself and family have work in the hospitality industry for year and i could have never image an employee treat someone this way .,0,98
"i be actually very impressed with legacy vacation club . we have the 3 bedroom condo unit for 7 night . the entire unit be clean and comfortable . tv ' s in the bedroom and living room . the coffee maker be break but the swap it out on request . i love the jetted tub , very relax after a full day at a theme park or explore the area . also on the last day they hold out luggage after we check out since there be several hour after check out before our flight .",1,98
"this hotel be ok. not too great but no big complaint either . everything look a bit outdated , but the room seem clean and the staff be friendly and accommodate . i prefer the hampton over this , but my dad book the hotel this time and this be the result . if you ' re just look for a place to sleep , you ' ll be fine here . if i could describe this hotel in one word : eh . also , the hallway kind of smell and the free breakfast be tasteless .",0,98
"the place where dream be take away . disney be an absolute rip off . everything be overprice by a margin of at least 300 % ( rough estimate ) and the line be ridiculous . after pay for more than $ 100 per ticket , the line be so long you ' re lucky to get in one ride during the blistering heat and disgust humidity . disney suck . it be a complete waste of time and money , and despite the copious amount of money waste , i would rather have my time back .",0,98
"stay here during a recent trip to orlando with the family . the pool be enormous , and the kid absolutely love the water slide and lazy river . the lobby and general decor of the hotel be excellent , and the staff be generally very friendly and accommodate . the only downside be that the bus service to the disney park be a bit spotty and not a frequent a i expect to market the hotel a have super easy access to disney . overall , though , a very nice hotel and good experience .",1,97
i find this hilton to be ok but not amazing . the room be clean but the carpet be pull up in my room and the pillow weren ' t comfortable at all . the best part be the free bus to disney but they all have that in this area . breakfast buffet be $ 30 which be kind of ridiculous if you ask me . kid everywhere be loud but it ' s disney so that ' s to be expect . i would try another hotel if i go back to the area .,1,97
"room be great but from a business , and yes i understand tourist location , stop have convention here . worse place in the world . i can not log into the internet to do my work . no convention should be hold in orlando at the convention center because no hotel can handle the load of tourist , who do not know what they be do , and the business traveler who have work to do . orlando chose one or the other . can ' t even post my response because internet be terrible .",0,97
"we love our stay here while go to the universal studio amusement park . we be there in the winter and the outdoor pool be so so perfectly heat . it be a large pool , with two jacuzzi in a closed area . all just heavenly . the hotel be quite large , but the staff do a good job of manage the traffic of guest . the room be very pleasant , and not a large a some but certainly we have enough room for hang out and have fun together a a family .",1,97
"we book a 2 bedroom villa here because of an event we be attend . we have no foreknowledge of this hotel , and limited expectation . . . . wow be it a very pleasant surprise ! from the room service ( excellent selection , service and pricing ) , to the pool ( the kid love the slide , waterfall etc. ) , to the staff encounter ( not a single bad attitude ) . . . all top notch , especially for the price ! we definitely recommend this place to anyone !",1,96
i stay here for about two week and i find everything to be great for the most part . the staff and housekeeping be great . when i check in my room be spotless and the bed and pillow be so comfortable . the pool be nice and big and be always clean . the only problem i have be the overpriced and disgust restaurant in the hotel . don ' t let the outside of this hotel fool you it ' s a great place to stay and i will definitely be back again !,1,96
"read the review ! ! the website misrepresents the current state of the property . rate charge be way over price for the room . the wait line to check in be 25 minute long , elevator didn ' t work , bed not comfortable , dirty , bang up furniture , shower be leak and shower head broken , mold in bathroom . buyer beware ! there be much better property to book a stay at the rate charge . oh and they charge a resort fee for what i do not know . disappointed",0,96
so far this place get a single star from me for the simple fact that they tell me i would have a king room and have a room with two double bed . then they pretty much just tell me oh well we don ' t have any available . wouldn ' t even mind that much accept i be 6 ' 4 '' and weigh about 290. . . . . oh and be tell i would have a king bed . i be here for 5 day too to make it even worse .,0,96
"steer clear of this hot mess of a hotel , except of course if you don ' t mind bug , dirty room , unmaintained walkway , staff that be barely trained and know what ' s go on . this hotel be not maintain , and despite it relatively recent renovation , the place be fall apart . i can ' t imagine anyone want to return to this hotel after their first day . the staff generally seem bother , and be ill- inform on what ' s go on in the property .",0,96
stay her for one night before i have to go to universal studio . . get the employee rate or else it woulda be a bit pricey . when we walk in i be kinda surprised cuz it be very different look . pretty cool though . we get there at like 1130 or 12 at night so we didn ' t take advantage of the location and all the night spot close to it . . would definitely go back ! ! comped breakfast cuz the fire alarm go off so everything be great .,1,96
"not nearly a bad a some would have you believe . this be much nicer than a motel 6 ! our room ' s age spot be mostly cover up . the counter staff seem to try to be nice , and it ' s probably not entirely their fault if they ' re unhelpful . our trip come with a free snake sighting , and only one extra room guest ( a tiny ant . . . didn ' t take up much room ) . glad we ' re on the second floor .",0,96
stay with my group at this hotel we call a limo company for our group the security trespass the limo company and force u to use yellow cab lol we spend so much money in this propriety and they treat u like they do u a favor and don ' t give u option when it come to service we have to walk to the street to get to our limo because they don ' t allow them to pick u up and trespass the driver mng have to rethink about hotel policy and security employee,0,96

"absolutely wonderful , but everything be extra , parking , wifi , etc . a candy bar and an 8oz soft drink $ 8+ everything be spotless and the staff make you feel like royalty . they could use more attention to building detail , lamp crook , chandelier do not line up properly . service excellent but do they really need to charge so much for coffee and soda ? ? bed be fantastic ! housekeep service twice a day and the little chocolate on pillow be heaven . chocolate , raspberry and chamomile .",1,96
"i may be a little harsh with give this place 3 star , but honestly , if you have a crappy night of sleep due to a bed that feel like the sidewalk i think it ' s justified . the rest of the property be very nice , well maintain and large ! i go on a few morning run around the complex which be a great selling point for me . it ' s also super close to the convention center if you be attend a conference like we do and very inexpensive .",1,96
"i stay here often . the room be modern and be redo about 3 year ago . the hallway be still sort of old and they have a new lobby a of about a year ago , which be nice and bright . the van driver be usually cool ( mostly all college dude ) , but they be friendly and talkative . there be not much to do around the area , unless you like hooter ! : ) and be sure to check out the alligator in their pond near the pool !",1,95
the hotel be very accommodate to our need . i like the perk of stay there . only thing i have to say be get a rental car because only eat their food be enough after our second day . food be ok but i rather eat at other place . room be small but i kind of expect that also no microwave but at least a fridge so we couldn ' t complain . we still enjoy our 7 day 6 night stay . yay disney and i would stay again . . .,1,95
"the place have bedbugs ! i saw two bedbug on the sheet - one adult form and one larval form . the management apologize but didn ' t seem surprise . when i ask to be comp- ed two night for the trouble , the management refuse , refund me one night , and move me to an equally shabby room . luckily , i saw the bed- bug and be able to decontaminate my stuff before coming home . i ' d avoid this place - it ' s not worth the hassle .",0,95
"stay here a few time , but most recently on my wedding night and it be just lovely a usual . i have not experience the jacuzzi suite until a couple of month ago and it be totally worth any extra cost . not sure what that cost would be since the room be a wedding present but it be sooo worth it ! ! the entire hotel , room , pool . . . it ' s all gorgeous . i enjoy stay here even though i live minute away . love it .",1,95

"we spend a week in orlando for a family vacation . the resort we stay at have one master bedroom and one decent size bedroom for my brother and i. we didn ' t spend too much time explore the resort , but the room be always clean and tidy when we get back every night . it be also great to have a kitchen so we didn ' t have to eat out every night . my parent love it so much they purchase a timeshare here .",1,89
"i really like my stay here . close to theme park and locate in a nice area . they have a schedule for those who stay more than a week . go anywhere isn ' t even need bc there be so much to do during the day . they have movie to show while you ' re in the pool , which i go to and it be super fun . the whole area be super huge and fun to walk around . i love this place .",1,89
"i think this place be gon na `` rock '' . i be go to a concert at the hard rock live inside the universal property so why not stay at the hotel a well . the location be great the hotel be okay , but the room be garbage . felt like a budget hotel which be fine . fine except that it be $ 350 a night . not a budget at all . plus my room be very damp . i will not be back .",0,89

"reserve a king well in advance . they give my room to the person check in ahead of me ; i hear her say she request a double but would they upgrade to a king . they do and when i check in , they tell me they only have a double . . . i know why . then at checkout they charge me the king rate . even after call to fix it they overcharge me anyway . stay elsewhere for the rest of the trip .",0,89
"their slogan be `` make yourself at home ! `` i think this be an interesting and think provoke approach . i be go to ( section redact for your protection ) and then ( omg ! you don ' t want to read this either ) and finally ( i ' m pretty sure this be illegal in most state ) but then , i decide to save this for my real home . have a great stay but consider carefully how you interpret the slogan !",1,88
"this hotel be certainly convenient , but not worthy of 4 yelp star or a 4 start hotel rating . wake up in the morning to find that none of my electronics charge because the wall plug be inop . the room be generally tire and somewhat worn . nice flat screen tv with nothing but analog station ! really , at a hyatt regency . . . . come on ! nothing real negative , but no big positive either except maybe for the friendly staff .",1,88
"please read this before you go to this place ! this place be build in the stone age , no joke . on the 2nd night , we have some guest that never check out . . . yea , bed bug ! a child stay with u get it and have these huge mark all over his body . we werent compensate a much we a hop for , but we be help . this place be a drag and a dead place . not fun !",0,88
"my family and i stay here one night for a weekend at disney . the bathroom be disgust ! ! ! it smell like sweat , have mold on the door , have someone else ' s hair on the floor , and cover with rust . the refrigerator didn ' t work and the door lock wouldn ' t stay in place ! i guess you get what you pay for . . . next time i will pay the extra money to go somewhere else !",0,88
"very clean , flat screen tv , room service until until 11pm and the pool be awesome . disney be about 10 mile away . but wob be about 3 mile away . if you walk out of the hotel and go to your right past and cross the street there be a red lobster and other place . more importantly there be a store that sell wine and beer at pretty close to regular price . all and all this hotel be just ok to me .",1,88
"one of the better hilton resort we ' ve stayed . overall great staff , very welcome ! you can share the waldorf pool and spa if you want . the hotel connect . they have shuttle service every half hour to the attraction park . parking and resort fee be additional ! we come during a renovation , a little noisy or else this would have be a 5 star ! . the employee and rest of the staff exceptional service ! ! overall great experience !",1,88
"bug ! ! ! ! i will never ever come near this place ever again ! ! ! ! their room smell so old , their customer service suck . when i go to the front desk to tell the lady about the bug i saw on the bed and crawl around my daughter she be mock me in front of the manager and they both didn ' t show any empathy at all ! ! ! ! please do not stay here ! ! ! ! !",0,88
"for $ 45 the room be clean , have no bad smell , they bring u extra sheet promptly at 11 pm and try to refuse a tip . the bed be comfortable , the toiletry be good , the shower pressure be strong and the water be hot . check in be easy and quick . the location be close to disney . there be free wifi and kuereg coffee maker with 2 k- cup in the be . overall , i would definitely come back !",1,88
"be to disney just about every year since it open in 1971. first trip back for about 10 year . with 3 boy age 15 , 10 & amp ; 2 , all there first time and my husband first also . i remember eveything always be so clean and well organize and maintain . but this time all the bathroom be in bad need of attention . any of the staff member we approach for help with something be quite hostile . very dissapointed this time .",1,88
"this be probably one of the better hotel near the airport . the room be clean and the staff be very friendly . i ' ve stay here twice with no issue what so ever . they offer a free shuttle to and from the airport a well a local business . they have a free breakfast buffet which consist of assorted pastry , egg , bacon , sausage , potato , cereal , yogurt , toast and oatmeal . you can ' t go wrong here .",1,88
because it be close to the convention center be the only benefit to stay here . not sure the price match quality . yea i ' m sure it doesn ' t. place be in dire need of a remodel . wall and door have be paint but the work look shoddy . ceiling have stain and sign of mildew . bath fixture be tarnish . no in room fridge or microwave . no spare pillow or blanket . night clerk need some serious customer service training .,0,88
"ehhh , i wouldn ' t stay again . the room be nice and clean . it have two room and a kitchen . it be like a little apartment . but it felt like a tourist trap . the pool be small and crowd . no breakfast in the morning . the arcade that be advertise be the size of a walk in closet . if you need a place to sleep and don ' t plan on leave the room then this be your place .",0,88
"this be a new hotel on the block the room be very clean and nicely appoint . the lobby be open and spacious . the location be great a it ' s walk distance to several good restaurant and a movie theatre . wifi be a pay for performance service , it have free wifi , but very slow you basically can pay up to 20 dollar a day for the fastest internet access . the slow work fine for my purpose for e- mail etc .",1,87
"check in last night . place be fine- not great . this place be tuck away and be locate near numerous restaurants- which be good since other than a continental breakfast there be no food here . would be nice if our ice machine work , but the floor above u have on so it ' s a short walk . would never choose this place if i didn ' t have to stay here for the field hockey tourney , but it ' s fine .",0,87
"we can always count on hilton wherever my family go on vacation ! here be the hilton orlando bonnet creek , not only be the hotel modern , comfortable , convenient but a great resort for family with child ! the hotel have a great location , pool , gym , cafes/ restaurant , perfect size room , arcade and clothing store . in addition it be next to a great golf course ! the staff be very attentive which always make the experience even better .",1,87
"wonderful hotel ! it be - enormous- and we get incredibly great rate . . . $ 100/ night . book a room literally 45 min before check in and get it through travel zoo . our room be large , clean , and smell great . large bed which be comfortable and the bathtub be larger than normal . very large pool area and everyone work there be super nice . highly recommend and will def stay here next time i ' m in orlando !",1,87
"this be a wonderful resort , but not very convenient for an older couple . it ' s very family friendly but there be only one very casual eating place . unfortunately , my sister- in- law get quite ill and my brother- in- law be blind so they be strand when we be not able to get there . the unit be very nice and clean and check- in staff very friendly . we only book this resort when another marriott resort be not available .",1,87
"this be an update from my previous review : it seem that the bus system be change to the disney bus line , so the service quality will show marked improvement . unfortunately , i be no longer service- connect and can no longer stay there . probably the most disappointing part of be a civilian so far ! i will never recant my opinion that stay at shade of green be quite literally the best idea for anyone go to stay on property for disney .",1,87
"only the renovation room be ok ! i stay there 3 day and my stay be just ok ! my friend have a room but be old n dirty ! renovate room be the best for your buck but they don ' t have many have to request1 ! they have bar , restaurant and game room for kid on location . not a real resort but for 100 & amp ; under at this location u be win ! just try best to get renovated room",0,87
"stay here several week and fully satisfied . very clean and well maintain . staff helpful and friendly . they take great pride in provide a safe and secure facility . le service than in a more expensive motel and room must be maintain by the resident with once weekly servicing . linen and towel can be exchange on request and pay laundry facility be conveniently locate within the building . kitchen utensil , internet , and additional service be available at additional but reasonable cost .",1,87
"typical low budget disney area hotel . stick there because i book late for an orlando soccer tournament over the holiday . if you be ok with paper thin wall , loud kid and mile long breakfast line where cinnamon roll don ' t even get a chance to heat up they be garb so fast . . . this might be the place for you . add slow internet and analog tv . . . no thanks . it be in a decent location though .",0,87
"i only stay here one night- - my mistake ! i check in ask if there be a room with a balcony ( i smoke ) . they say no , but they ' d give me a suite fir the same price . i end up in a beautiful hospitality suite ( maximum occupancy 78 people ) ! get a wonderful room service dinner and a fantastic in- room massage . wish i ' d stay there the entire time ! next time i will !",1,87
pretty much a semi- dump ! right in front of the local prison where casey anthony once reside and surround by bail bond joint . there be a pool here that everyone seem to enjoy . there be an ihop next door if you get hungry . the free continental breakfast be weak a there wasn ' t any yogurt or adult size bagel . they have a bar/ restaurant inside but it close on sunday . staff be very nice but this place be poorly keep,0,87
"if it be away from the interstate or if the interstate and construction didn ' t sound like it be in the room or if i couldn ' t hear the people above me take every step , i would rate it a 3. the breakfast be very limited and should not have be advertise a `` deluxe. `` the room be ok and the kitchen have enough utensil and plate for 4. i would not stay here again unless it be the only thing available .",0,87
"the front desk employee and reservation staff be not capable of follow direction . let ' s just say that if you reserve a room on a specific floor here don ' t expect to have it . no matter how much in advance you make it . and when you question them about it , they get offend like you insult their mother . . talk about lack of customer service . but then again what do you expect from a best western . . .",0,87
disappoint ! way over price for what you get . close proximity to epcot be really the only thing go for this place . the door hinge inside my room have visible rust . i ' d expect that at a road side flop house . but not at a upper tier disney property that cost u over $ 600 . 00 per night . do yourself a favor and stay at the nearby waldorf astoria . significantly better room and service for much le money .,0,87
"i should have update this sooner . after write my previous review a friend advise me to leave a complaint on twitter . i do this and immediately they contact me . within two day i have a full refund for the inconvenience . i really only be look for a partial refund to offset the additional cost after everything but i appreciate the gesture . moral of the story be don ' t bother with the hotel , go straight to corporate via social medium .",1,87
"i would have give this place three star , but the one time i stay here , back in 2014 , i go home to discover that i have ringworm on my leg ! my then- girlfriend blurt out , `` yup , not stay there again ! do they wash their sheet ! ? ! `` outside of that , it be just an average low- cost place to stay . i wasn ' t expect the fairmont , but at least keep it clean !",0,87
"i stay in celebration hotel for one night . if you ' re look to stay in celebration , this be the only hotel . i have the opportunity to stay in a beautiful suite with a view of the lake . this isn ' t a hotel to go to if you ' re look for excitement or entertainment . only come here if you ' re look for an intimate weekend . i love the hotel , the food and celebration , fl .",1,86
"overall stay be fine , the hotel be far away from the attraction so you don ' t get the all the traffic other hotel have . hotel be clean and staff be friendly . the lobby be large with a nice size breakfast din area which have decent breakfast item . the area have lot place to eat and a starbucks close by . the only thing i would say that could use some improvement be the washing sink that be a bit small .",1,86
"i enjoy this hotel , and would have give it five star if they have free breakfast . we have a few people try to hassle u to join some club everytime i go into the lobby , but i tell them i be poor and they leave me alone after that . the biggest perk to this hotel be the gigantic hot tub in our room . i ' m definitely go to stay here next time i ' m in town for seaworld .",1,86
"unsafe place . my car ' s window get crack in the parking lot . when i talk to the manager about this , the manager show his impatience and bad attitude . he doesn ' t want to deal anything without make more profit . also discover 3 cockroach in room and bed . elevator have several button not light up and one not exist . be book at the last minute . can ' t complain too much . will not recommend this place",0,86
i attend a holiday party at the alfond inn and thoroughly enjoy it . the food be quite delicious and the staff be courteous and attentive . the hotel be beautiful and the ground be too . it ' s a shame that the party be hold in one of the windowless ball room because they just don ' t do justice to the rest of the surroundings . i look forward to dining and drinking there without a party of 200 in the future .,1,86
one of the worst disney resort i have stay in . awfully outdated and one of the most uncomfortable bed i have ever try to sleep in . my back be so sore the first day i be dread the second night of sleep in it . and they put u in bldg 39 which be literally a 5 min drive from the lobby so there be not chance of walk anywhere other than in circle around the building i would not recommend stay here .,0,86
"we stay here for 8 day and love it . there be beach , hammock , multiple pool and a jogging trail . the resort have a bus that will take you around the resort . disney transportation will also pick you up near your building to take you to the park . the only thing i be disappoint in be the food option . the sit down restaurant be only open for dinner . the food court do not always have all station open .",1,86
"we make a reservation for non smoking room but we get a smoking room instead . although we be tell that the room be convert to a non smoking room , we saw clearly that the room be use recently . ash tray , smoke bud etc . it be such bad experience for my kid . there be no parking lot either . i be not sure why you lie to customer . move to embassy suite . we get a non smoking room !",0,86
"we stay here for a couple day recently and i be surprise that marriott would have a hotel like this . the staff be friendly enough , but here be a few bullet point worth note : * bed be uncomfortable * horrible layout* le than appetizing breakfast* odor in the hallways* do i say the bed be uncomfortable ? stay somewhere else unless you have no other choice . if you don ' t mind stay in motel , then this may be ok .",0,86
"not your best place , but be a life saver due to u not have to drive far back home after a long day in kissimmee , they have availability , the room be ok , it have coffee , soap , extra towel at least . the only thing we didn ' t like be when you flush the toilet and someone else be take a shower , that person will get burn ! and the carpet felt dirty . the staff be nice .",0,86
"approximately three mile from ucf be a modern hotel , offer a free hot breakfast bar , heat outdoor pool and fitness center , plus free parking . while in the area for work , my bos and i be able to get a two- room suite for a night , with a flat screen tv , desk , mini- fridge , and coffeemakers . free wi- fi be available in all room . customer service be great a they make you feel at home .",1,86
"i love my stay here ! the outdoor pool area be gorgeous and the water slide be awesome ! the bar and grill by the pool be awesome and even with the crowd , the service be pretty good ! the room be nice and the room service staff be amaze ! they have forget my yogurt with breakfast and no sooner have i hung up the phone , the lady knock on the door with it ! great service and fun place to stay !",1,86
"really nice and helpful staff . pool , clean room ( no bed bug or roach ) , nice bathroom , it be great to have a microwave , coffee machine and mini fridge in the room . free breakfast , not amaze but pretty good . it ' s not a close to attraction park a some of the other resort and hotel but really great stay for the price ( about 15 away so still not bad ) ! ! i recommend it .",1,86
"very poor marriott hotel , if you want to use the internet at all good luck do it at the fairfield , can ' t even load google in under 5 minute ! ! have to go to the courtyard in the lobby to get a good connection , room be very ran down , spend the extra money and go to the courtyard ! not to mention traffic on this exit be about a bad a it get good luck drive anywhere 5- 9 !",0,86
"the same person that check u in , be the same person who serve u a drink and put out breakfast in the morning . good- $ 79 corporate rate ( i be just a shock ) - free wi- fi , breakfast , and parking- close to i- 4bad- 30 mile from the airport- the bathroom light win ' t turn on unless the light switch by the door be on ( this be fun to figure out in the middle of the night )",1,86
"this hotel be a perfect spot to stay at if you be visit disney world and do not want to stay in the park . it be clean , spacious , and have a great free breakfast every morning . i will stay here any time . also , i forget an item in my room and the front desk staff be really helpful in help me retrieve it after get a hold of anyone in housekeeping seem unlikely . thanks for all the help !",1,86
"a a hotel , the room a spacious and well appoint . the hotel be fairly large & amp ; very bland . service by the staff be well mean & amp ; earnest . food be absolutely horrible along with the wait time . it all seem to all come from the same kitchen and not a describe in the menu . if this be your home base but eat elsewhere , then it ' s fine . just don ' t eat here .",0,86
"such a great experience . we get to breakfast late ( which we have pay for in advance ) so the lady who seem to be the manager take me and my wife over to the deli area and let u grab a bunch of item for free for breakfast . above and beyond service and we leave very happy . the hotel be really nice , super close to the airport which they offer a free shuttle to and from . 5 star experience .",1,86
"fu* * * * * k you disney with your `` random '' spot check ! i be choose three time in one day ! the only thing that be accomplish by this be that you create a very irate guest which become belligerent to your staff , other guest and even child ! you be all a bunch of racist bastard ! i ' m no longer renew my yearly pas . i ' m do with you all together ! ! ! ! !",0,86
"this hotel be beautifully decorate . i stay in a room with a king bed and it be large , clean , and quiet . they have some nice in- room amenity include a couple of hbo channel , aveda product , and flat screen tv . there be a few cable channel available but not a huge selection . parking be $ 8/ night in their gated lot , which be a reasonable price - just a good thing to know before you go .",1,86
this be the second time we have stay here and our son and his wife have stay here a well . we love this place . the studio be basically a slightly expanded hotel room but very comfortable with fridge and microwave ( but no dishwasher or washer and dryer. ) perfect for a week in this wonderful and entertaining city . excess access and lot of great restaurant nearby on i- drive . nice pool . we will be back here again next summer !,1,86
"the continental breakfast suck . . . . you can get waffle , cereal , oatmeal packet , coffee , juice , toast , pb and jelly packet . there be no fruit , egg , or anything else really . . . i come here with a groupon . . . . other than the crappy , non- existent bfast . . . the room be decent . close to the park and with the groupon deal i be very happy with my stay .",0,86
"let ' s just get to the heart of it . if this be not a conference , i would leave . no healthy option on the grab n go ( yogurt with granola be not healthy , if you be watch sugar ) . buffet not open early . fitness center not 24 hour . paper thin wall . front desk staff le than interested in check anyone in . good hairdryer though , which be why it be 2 star instead of 1 .",0,86
"the staff be really helpful , but they can ' t make up for an overused facility . there be no outlet in my room that will hold a plug without the plug fall out . i think i charge all my electronics overnight . couldn ' t believe that all the connection be so poor none of them charge . i have to almost hold the plug to the wall plate to get a good connection . at a convention hotel this be crazy .",0,86
"i can ' t say enough about bluegreen property . they be always beautiful , clean , and full of fun activity . the fountain ' be locate central to all of the main attraction of orlando , fl . there be a multitude of thing to do for both the adult and child include an arcade , two swimming pool , playground , fire pit , fishing , gym , activity director , bingo , and daily child ' s activity . . . .",1,86
"this be my first time to this resort , i be impress with how friendly the staff be . the room , furnishing and appliance be clean and in excellent condition . the bed be very comfortable and the tv be just the right size . i would ' ve give it five star except i didn ' t utilize the golf course , so i can ' t comment on the pricing or condition of the course . i would definitely stay here again .",1,86
some of the positives- it ' s just a short walk from down town disney & amp ; the staff be all really nice . you get all the amenity you should expect from a 3 . 5 star hotel . the negatives- the ac . unit be obnoxiously loud . the bathroom be a little award and small . i wouldn ' t mind stay here again but price would be bigger decide factor than distance between all the hotel in this corridor .,1,85
"stay here for a conference last week . i wonder how they can get away by charge $ 400+ for this place . the bigger wonder be why people choose to come here and gladly pay $ 400+ for this place . ok , aside from the excellent service , micky sticker , access to 4 disney theme park , and other attraction , this place be a dump . it need new carpet , furnishing , bathroom remodel . . . . . .",0,85
"stay for a couple day , nothing really special about this place have to call up to the front desk a couple time to get thing do . also look forward to out of date a. c. unit . my family end up move room due to a got room with non work air condition even after maintainance ( ray ) which be a very nice guy try his best to fix . needle to say we win ' t be stay here again .",0,85
"nice and clean hotel . friendly staff and who doesn ' t love the yummy cooky at check in . great location . wall be thin so i can hear every conversation and it ' s near the rail road so if you like to hear train at 10 at night . curtain aren ' t opaque so i wake up all morning from sun in my eye . besides pay $ 17/ night to park my own car , everything else be gravy .",1,85
"do not stay here unless they get new upgrade and new management ! not enough sign to direct you , restaurant too expensive for family . it be 11 : 30 at night and we still can not sleep due to noise at the pool . have call front desk 4 time and talk to manager about it . manager do not care . do send security to ask them to quiet down at pool but that do not help . avoid this place .",0,85
this be the only hotel available in the maitland area last night and it be a disaster . the room smell like bleach which would assume it be clean but i felt dirt all over and resort to sleep in my sweat and sock for fear of bed bug . base board and wall socket be miss which may mean they be renovate but no mention be make or indicate that his be so . will not stay in one of these hotel again .,0,85
"not a bad hotel , not a great hotel . decent location , but noisy due to countless child run around . bedding : modern and comfortablebathroom : outdatedwi- fi : pay & amp ; fast/ reliableparking : ample- $ 10 facility feegym : nightstand outlet : yestv : didn ' t usefridge : yesmicrowave : yescoffee bar : yeshotel bar : yesmake a green choice : yesother comment : very nice hotel , good location with restaurant within walk distancewould return ? : yes",0,85
we stay here for 1 night and i have to say probably win ' t be back . we get in and order room service because all the quick food place be already close it be only 9 : 00 and we didn ' t want to do a sit down restaurant . the room service be ok take about an hour . be disappointed that the only fridge be a mini bar with highly price item . the room be clean seem small .,0,85
this review be purely for the terrible bar . 910 pm . i be tell i can ' t grab a drink because the po be close . tell that if i can get cash i can get a drink . otherwise i can not get a drink . sadly this be the name of the game with the manager . i feel terrible that andrew and tim work for these unprofessional people . they ' re the best bartender in this city .,0,84
best deal in the orlando area . nice hotel too . i like the high table in the lobby . front desk very pleasant during check- in and the room be clean . only knock - tv selection . it ' s one of those hotel with the 123- 1 or 138- 2 channel . take forever to find what you be look for and channel take a while to load . i recommend they switch to directv and get that 5th star .,1,84
"do not use the concierge at this hotel . it be a third party that up the price well beyond the normal price . in fact , you can walk to the store not 50 foot away and get a normal price . we be lie to even after confront the person work . however , the hotel be nice and the pool be amaze . this , however , be a bad experience . it make u think poorly of the hotel .",1,84
"i recently visit disney world for the very first time and it be mouse- nificent , i ' ve alway heard these park operate a efficient a a well oil machine and after decade of provide the ultimate fantasy experience for generation of kid and adult alike , they have perfect the art of entertain and have leave a lasting impression on million . disney be the epitome of customer service it ' s like every employee here have take a happy pill .",1,84
"great place to stay if you travel with family . it ' s locate in a street where you can walk to a lot of restaurant and you get a lot for your money if you eat breakfast and dinner at the hotel . they have free shuttle to universal . i only wish the pool be a bit bigger , especially on those hot summer day when all you do be lounge at the pool after a busy day at the park .",1,84
absolutely beautiful ! my family and i stay here last month august 2011 and we couldn ' t have be any more pleased with everything . the hotel room itself felt like home it be very clean and spacious . the pool be incredible and clean ! my kid love it ! the staff be very friendly too . we go to orlando to go to the theme park but we enjoy the hotel much more . keep it up shertaon vistana village !,1,84
"ate breakfast here again and it be just a bad a the last time . breakfast sausage be very greasy . the small chicken sausage have a very strange taste . the flax muffins taste like there be soap in them . but the worse part be that , no matter what you select in the buffet , it go on an ice cold plate , which make anything you put on it cold by the time you get back to the table .",0,84
"very nice hotel ; clean and the room be very nice . unfortunately the hotel front desk staff ' s customer service skill be abysmal and the night time manager ' s be even worse . they fail miserably on all level to rectify a very minor problem i have with the surprise fee i be not inform about prior to book my room . so beware , stay at the rosen centre hotel can cost you a lot more then you expect !",0,84
"not bad for the money . i stay here during a trade show in orlando , and pay le than $ 60. what i get be a polite staff , efficient check in , and clean room . they have wifi , well- lit parking , and no surprise . a good value that i will stay at again when travel on business . when i return for pleasure , however , it be `` big chain '' all the way . : )",0,84
"good location and price , however , they have roach ! i saw one in the bathroom the morning i be leave . i didn ' t tell my boyfriend because we be leave in a couple hour . a day later he confess to me that he have seem a few roach , one crawl on to his laptop while he be use it . baby roach , which mean they be mat in the wall all around you . pretty foul !",0,84
"i recently have the absolute worst experience at the altamonte spring , fl location - believe it or not , they give my confirmed reservation away ! to complicate matter , the asst . manager , nicole phillips , be le than helpful in resolve matter . i travel frequently and have be a loyal marriott fan for 15+ year , but i be re- thinking my allegiance after this most recent experience . extremely disappointing - especially from a guest centric company !",0,84
"don ' t stay here ! lot of freeway noise , musty , smelly room , mold in the bathroom , hair in the shower , a/ c barely work , a huge roach land on the shower curtain when i be take a shower . kudos to the manager who attempt to keep me a a customer by move room and comping me one night ' s stay , but i don ' t think i ' m go back . ever .",0,84
"currently a ramada inn . . . this be a pretty bad hotel . where to start ? overall run down , bed smell like mold , carpet be disgust , tv barely work , and shower curtain fail to reach the tub ! the good ? the in- wall air conditioner keep the room like an igloo and the breakfast be in the lobby a promise . : ) i have high standard and this just doesn ' t cut it .",0,83
"this a review of the bar area . we ' re currently guest pay over $ 1 , 000 a night to stay here . the bar area at 945p at night be filthy and very disorganized . we have to walk by 5 table that be dirty . the bartender then give u attitude about mention the filth and that we be wait to then be serve on the patio . we definitely expect better from this supposedly elite hotel brand .",0,83
"if you ' re into nostalgia , then this be a great place . if you have kid , great place for them and you . but if you want fun ride and the chance to buy an express pas that isn ' t just for 3 ride ? i recommend universal . i have so much more fun there . disney be alright , i ' m glad i experience it , but i probably win ' t be back again .",0,83
we check out after a couple of hour after feel ill. the room be disgustingly dirty and we find visible mold grow on two separate lamp shade . i call back after a week of wait for my refund . i give them a second chance to make thing right by issue the refund . today i check my account and find that they charge me a second time for my stay . avoid this hotel and this company . very disappointed .,0,83
beautiful hotel but beware if you go there for an event and park in their convention center parking lot . there be one small exit gate to serve hundred of park spot . you will sit in your car in a traffic jam for a very long time . and you will pay $ 18 for the privilege of park here and waste your valuable time . c ' mon hotel management - you can and should figure out a better system !,0,83
"i stay here on a business trip and find the place great . the room be big and recently update , the bathroom be a little cramped but that be understandable in a property of this type . really friendly staff who be happy to help with anything i need a well . it ' s not a resort with a spa or ocean view but if you be look for somewhere to stay at a reasonable rate be a great option .",1,83
"very convenient to disney without the traffic . the property be a little difficult to find . room curtain do not keep out light sufficiently . room be clean . mattress wasn ' t great . breakfast be a typical hiexpress spread . quickly replenish . fitness center be small but adequate . elevator be out of service one night , but it be fix by the next morning . front desk be professional and helpful . i would stay here again .",1,83
"the contemporary have the charm of an airport , complete with noisy crowd and a fast- food court at the center . style be retro futuristic , room be standard , have a balcony be nice . not be a disney addict i find it overprice and mildly depressing to see so many overweight people . what i like : food quality in the dinner restaurant , the monorail go through the building , be able to see magic kingdom firework .",0,82
"i be a little weary about stay here because of the price , and because i have previously stay at the extended stay next door . however , i be very pleasantly surprise . the lobby and hallway have a modern feel and look like they have recently be remodel . the entire staff be very friendly and willing to help . the room be spacious and very clean . i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone !",1,82
"great price motel . bad remodel only in the fact that they put caulk over caulk instead of remove it first . very quiet hotel . there be a hair dryer in the room so no need to pack . there be breakfast . pretty decent . no waffle . the staff should probably wait to get there food after the guest . hot water , good pillow , and a decent bed . worth stay at for a budget motel .",0,82
"if price be of no concern and you want proximity to walt disney world , this be your place ! resort have be remodel and room be very spacious . amenity be great and transportation to other disney venue and resort be superb . my child would rate this resort a a 5+ a they love the monorail access , pool , and room . overall i would give it 4 . 5 star and rate in top 5 disney resort .",1,82
we stay here from 12/ 24/ 15 until 12/ 27/ 15 for a disney trip . the hotel be very close to the disney park so they do provide free shuttle . the lobby be nicely decorate for christmas and the front desk staff be courteous . the breakfast buffet be kinda pricey but that ' s to be expect . there ' s nothing overtly special about this hotel . overall i would stay here again if i have to .,0,82
very nice hotel . need a crib and manager be very accommodate and give u sheet and tell u the pack and play would be there when we get back . only downside of our stay be when we get back it wasn ' t there . have to go to the office and pick it up . the room be very clean and updated nicely . staff be friendly even though check in be a little slow due to training .,1,82
"this be a great option for service member and their family . the hotel be well kept , clean , and have a couple of good place to eat . their be free wi- fi , a good family technology center with computer access and a few game console to play on . the one downside be that there be no airport shuttle , however you can call a taxi or any other shuttle service and it not a big deal .",1,82
"while i only be here for a few day for training in one of their many space , i ' m very impressed with the hotel staff and cleanliness . there wasn ' t any question they couldn ' t answer and the starbucks style cafe downstairs have great employee and a wider selection of food and drink than expect . the decor be modern but inviting and i ' m impress with their attention to detail even with smaller group .",1,82
"just call their front desk to book a room . when i tell the receptionist my date of travel she say snap back , `` we ' re completely book '' and hang up the phone . wow . wasn ' t expect that from a marriott own hotel . no problem if there be no room available but that ' s not the way you talk to customer . not sure if i ' ll ever try book here again .",0,82
hotwire have this a a 3 star hotel . in reality be more of a 2 star category . location be good for disney world . but the a/ c do not cool enough . it be colder outside . not exceptionally clean . and the lake next to it be more of a swap . if you be on a budget it be still better than some motel 6. but in the disney maingate area there be definitively better option .,0,82
i go to this resort this past weekend when take a trip to disney world . the accommodation be clean and spacious but could definitely use some updating . a big draw be the shuttle service to disney so i wouldn ' t have to pay for park . they tend to run a little late so be sure you aren ' t on a tight schedule . it be an affordable room and i would definitely stay there again .,1,81
"if anyone from disney be read this , please , for the love of mickey , change the horrible new fastpass + system . there be no opportunity for spontaneity any longer - the software only cater to pre- planner and organize group and popular attraction be sell out prior to park opening . not a magical experience any longer . i ' m a long- time park goer and this be the worst thing they ' ve ever implement .",0,81
"my first impression of this hotel be not to great . we be give a smaller room than we pay for . after inspect the room and complaining to the front desk , we be move to the correct room . the room be clean and a nice size . we enjoy have the kitchen to make breakfast and store snack . a much a i like the space , i may try another resort on my next visit to orlando",1,81
little slow on the check in today . i get here at 3 : 30. didn ' t get my room until 4 : 30. they provide doughboy and popcorn in the lobby . my kid love it ! whitney perkins at the front saw my frustration for late check in and make me feel better . she provide great costumer service ! love my villa and kid will not get out of lazy river . will be back again .,1,81
really it deserve 2 . 5 . place be waaay over price for what it be . for the most part the room be clean . but who ever do the cleaning for get to put liner for the ice bucket and the two waste basket . on top of that they forget to vaccum the room completely and the desk chair be stain with disgusted white stuff ! . on the corner of the room there be peanut shell .,0,81
"very bad customer service . upon check in i ask if there be shuttle to the convention center , i be tell no - just start walk that way ( with a finger point ) turn out there be a shuttle for $ 2 ! the room be just ok for the price , very expensive . the cab driver that be summon by the hotel be incredibly rude and have a huge issue provide any reciepts . never again .",0,81
the bathroom be in serious need of an update and need to be clean more thoroughly . . . . the carpet need to be change . . . someone who speak even a littleenglish on the breakfast staff would be appreciate . . . . the lady at the front desk be very rude . . the bed be very uncomfortable . whew now the pro : the shuttle bus to the park ! my advice find another hotel !,0,81
hotel parking lot have limit park due to construction currently and be horrible to drive on . the room we have be consider pet friendly . the a/ c be not work properly and we keep find sugar ant . we find that the room smell from moisture or the a/ c. just honestly the room be very uncomfortable to sleep in with the a/ c not work . we be disappoint in our stay and change to another hotel .,0,81
"beautiful ground . only get to stay one day a we move over to the disney property , but next time we ' ll stay here the whole time ! the ground share with the jw marriott be gorgeous and there ' s so much to do , like the lazy river and beach volleyball . i be there for business and the catering kitchen be extremely accommodate of my food allergy and dietary restriction . wonderful service and room .",1,81
"hotel , staff , food , and amenity be great . what be not great be that one can not access wifi ! they advertise free wifi , but don ' t deliver it . another guest tell me there recently be 5 , 000 device try to connect . yesterday there be 2 , 000 , and we still could not get access . for shame , hilton ! this would definitely keep me from return to this hotel .",0,81
"great location , very close to orlando ' s convention center , within walk distance ! very big hotel with a lot of restaurant , conference room . however kind of expensive , then you be charge for use the fitness center & amp ; be charge $ 15 per day to park your car at the hotel . if you don ' t get a car , it ' s about $ 50 one way cab ride from airport .",0,81
"the property be nice , and i would stay here again . there be nothing particularly special about the property ( for example no lazy river ) but the room be clean , the staff very friendly , and the amenity more than adequate for the whole family . we find the location to be convenient for trip to food and activity on international drive without suffer from the noise and congestion of the main drag of international drive .",1,80
this place should be watch by the police . the drug deal go on at night it be bad . maintenance staff be also in on it a well . the bed be old an hard . tv be very bad with old tv set from 20 year ago . no internet it ' s down all the time . don ' t stay there it ' s a dump . go across the street to the best western .,0,80
"reserve a room with 2 bed for my family of 4 , receive a room with 1 bed and a pull out couch . the woman at the front desk try to convince me that this be the same and i should be ok with this . fail ! stay away folk . one of the most basic function of a hotel be accurately reserve room , if they screw that up what else be they screw up . .",0,80
"this place be pretty nice overall , and the advertised price didn ' t seem too bad , but i be surprise at how many amenity be not include in the price , thing that be almost always include at most other place . i would probably stay here again if it be the most convenient place to a conference , like it be this time - but i ' d definitely look elsewhere if there be other option .",0,80
"we stay here for a business conference . this be an average hotel . our biggest complaint be the lack of coffee to be find . or for that matter , the lack of quick sandwich or breakfast type of food available . food , a everything else in disney , totally overprice . they be have trouble with the air condition during our stay and our room have a very stale , musty , moldy odor to it .",0,80
"unfortunately on get u a much better hotel in downtown disney and we have a great week . p. s. the front desk offer to charge me the first night and give u the rest of the week for free , may sound like a god deal but a we be return the key to the front desk a giant rat run right in front of me a i walk into the main building . . . no thanks .",0,80
check in be easy . bed be comfortable . room layout be not to my liking . small bathroom . . . . small hidden closet for clothes . my room have one of those massive ac unit next to window . sound like a plane take off every hour when it kick on . this hotel would be an inexpensive choice if you must stay near airport . staff put cooky in my room which be nice .,0,79
just check in after a super long day of missed flight and the front desk attendant be so sweet she bring me the only thing i ' ve inquire about a glass of milk to my room . i wish the hotel would have like other chain do a recogrnize an employee note box a this doesn ' t happen every day at 1 be when someone go out of their way to accomodate a tired new guest .,1,79
"we get what we need a room close to disney . we take our own towel n bed which we do anywhere anyways n surprise we have a fridge , microwave and free hbo . overall good near all restaurant we be set . i would recommend this place if your look for a place to sleep n save $ don ' t spend over 80 if ur only go to sleep there . come here for that .",1,79
"amaze stay for a conference at this hotel . the staff be all polite and engage . even when there be hitch ( like a 30 minute wait on a reservation ) the staff make sure to keep u update a to why we be wait , that they be keep an eye on thing , and that they want to make it right . even the staff who clean up the conference center be smile and upbeat .",1,79
i be charge a massive resort fee without notification in advance ! the resort fee be almost the price of the hotel per night . once i find out about the resort fee they refuse to cancel the reservation . i even speak to the manager and he have the ability to help but he also refuse . i stay in a lot of hotel and this hotel have the worst customer i have to ever be too .,0,79
my boyfriend and i stay here for a night after arrive in orlando . the staff be extremely friendly and our room be great ! we have a king bed and there be also a couch and table you could sit at . the tv be very nice too ! the continental breakfast be surprisingly good a well . we each make our waffle . the juice and coffee be great a well ! would recommend this place !,1,79

"stay here after the airline bump me . the room smell moldy from the air conditioner . it be old , find another hotel . it be really odorous . i brew a cup of coffee to eliminate the odor . didn ' t work . next day the lawn service arrive and make noise . the pool have a problem with sand or backup . yuk . i can ' t believe it have a aaa rating .",0,79
be stay at this property for over 20 year . no longer recommend this resort a they have a bad practice of close most of their restaurant every night . the main reason to pay high marriott price to stay at a resort be to have access to their restaurant and not have to leave the property . sorry marriott but this cost cutting just do not cut it . it be very short sight and insult to guest,0,79
i ' ve be to this hyatt two year in a row for a professional business conference . i have to say i ' m so impressed with the facility and amenity . the landscaping and upkeep of the property be notable a well . i have lunch and snack and dessert here and it be above average for banquet food . the staff seem nice and happy to work there . i recommend this hotel/ resort .,1,78

"the price be about half of everything else in orlando this time of year and give the location ( walk distance to universal studio ) that ' s a real bargain . the hotel be very large and have multiple restaurant , pool and the staff have be very helpful . the room be very large and clean . no complaint at all . it would be a 5 if there be a wow factor .",1,76

the staff be all very nice . we actually have trouble get a functioning room but the staff kick into overdrive and resolve our room problem . the property itself be struggle . take a shower be an intricate dance . there be a rhythm of hot and lukewarm water come out of the showerhead . the drain stopper for the shower and sink be either not attach or not functional ( no bath ) .,0,76
"we strive to stay only at country inn and suite whenever we travel . from minneapolis to orlando they be all amazing . we arrive really early , 11 : 15 be and they not only allow u to check in early they have their famous warm cooky wait for u . price be right and service wonderful . and the breakfast almost competes with cracker barrel . one big difference- it free here .",1,75
one of the few hotel in orlando that charge over $ 20 to park . we pay to see the ice show with long walk or shuttle from the lot to be hit by park fee rip off during our exit . long wait get out for they need to collect the fee . unless you like be over charge to park do not come to gaylord palm . we will not be back .,0,75
"i stay at marriotts about three night a week , and have never have a bad customer service a i have here . they fail to give me a wake up call , double charge me for parking , and when i address the hotel manager he come out and act defensive . if you value a hotel , that treat you well , go out past the airport renaissance and find something else .",0,75

"$ 22 per day to park your own car ? $ 15 per day for internet $ 19 for enhance internet ? the only thing enhance be the insane fee charge for an orlando hotel . unless you ' re in nyc , south beach or a similar city you shouldn ' t be pay any parking fee . there be ton of other hotel that don ' t fee you to death .",0,74

"it should illegal for hotel to charge customer upwards of $ 50 . 00 per night a added mandatory fee . it ' s totally tricky , misleading , and shameful . they should be require to put it in the price of the hotel . i do not support hotel that do this . there be plenty of amaze option in orlando that do not have these confusing fee .",0,71
